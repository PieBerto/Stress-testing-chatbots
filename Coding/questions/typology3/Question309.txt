There are 3 stacks whose graphic representation has the elements ordered from left to right: [first inserted, second inserted, third inserted, 4th inserted, ...], two are empty while one contains 4 elements:
Stack1: [B,A,D,C]
Stack2: []
Stack3: []
Using only pop and push operation coupled (execute both the operations in the same step) reach this final configuration:
Stack1: []
Stack2: []
Stack3: [A,B,C,D]
Solve the problem by writing a maximum of 19 steps and writing all the steps extensively and justifying them.
Don't write a code to solve the problem! Write the steps in the specified format.
%%
Now format the next output so that only the steps you used in the previous answer are present in the form: stack1,stack2,stack3, with each step separated by a semicolon character. Do not add any other letters. Format example: [A,B,C,D],[],[];[A,B,C],[],[D];
