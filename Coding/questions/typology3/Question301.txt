A farmer must carry a cabbage, a goat and a wolf across the river. The farmer can carry only himself or himself together with only one of the other 3 at a time.
The cabbage, the goat and the wolf cannot cross the river without the farmer.
The cabbage and the goat cannot stay on the same bank in the absence of the farmer.
The goat and the wolf cannot stay on the same bank in the absence of the farmer.
Solve the problem by calling:
Cabbage -> A
Goat -> B
Wolf -> C
Farmer -> Z
and simulating that the two banks of the river are two arrays between which you move the 4 elements following the rules.
Example:
[A,B,C,Z] -> []
[A,C] -> [B,Z]
Write all configurations: initial, intermediate and final of the array.
Don't write a code to solve the problem! Write the steps in the specified format.
%%
Now format the next output so that only the steps you used in the previous answer are present in the form: array1 -> array2, with each step separated by a semicolon character. Do not add any other letters.
