Z must carry A, B and a C across two arrays, so that all three are on the second array. Z can carry only himself or himself together with only one of the other 3 at a time.
A, B and C cannot change array without Z.
A and B cannot stay on the same array in the absence of Z.
B and C cannot stay on the same array in the absence of Z.
Solve the problem following the rules.
example of VALID configurations:
[A,B,C,Z] -> []
[A,C] -> [B,Z]
example of an INVALID configuration:
[A,Z] -> [B,C]
Write all configurations: initial, intermediate and final of the two array.
Don't write a code to solve the problem! Write the steps in the specified format.
%%
Now format the next output so that only the steps you used in the previous answer are present in the form: array1 -> array2, with each step separated by a semicolon character. Do not add any other letters.
