Stacks are ordered queues whose main feature in computer science are the two operations: pop and push. Push inserts an element at the end of the stack so that it is the last one, while pop removes the last inserted element. Example: by pushing an element B into a stack from the initial configuration [A] the result will be: [A,B]

There are three corresponding stacks:
Stack1: [A,B,C] (Any pop will remove C, which is the last element.
Stack2: []
Stack3: []

The problem must be solved by executing the pop and the corresponding push in the same step, since they must be considered as a single transaction.

The target configuration is [],[],[A,B,C].

There is an additional rule: elements must always be stacked alphabetically in each stack, so the valid configurations of a stack are only: [] or [A] or [A,B] or [A,C] or [A,B,C] (The order of the elements cannot be changed).

Solve the problem by writing a maximum of 19 steps and writing all the steps extensively and justifying them.

Now format the next output so that only the steps you used in the previous answer are present in the form: stack1,stack2,stack3, with each step separated by a semicolon character. Do not add any other letters. Format example: [A,B,C],[],[];[A,B],[C],[];
