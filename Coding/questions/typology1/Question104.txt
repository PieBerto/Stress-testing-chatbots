%POT
What is the maximum point in the interval x = 0 and x = pi of the function y = x*sin(x) ?  Write a Python program to solve this problem; the answer must be formatted so that an external compiler can run it as is. Just write the code! The submitted code should return only the solution as output, avoiding adding other characters.
