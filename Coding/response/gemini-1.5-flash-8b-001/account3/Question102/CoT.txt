?1. **Identify the variables:**

* Present Value (PV): The amount to be invested now.
* Future Value (FV): The desired amount at retirement ($1,000,000).
* Interest rate (r): 5% per year, or 0.05 as a decimal.
* Number of years (n): 65 - 25 = 40 years.

2. **Choose the appropriate formula:**

We need to use the future value of a single sum formula, which calculates the future value of an investment earning compound interest. The formula is:

FV = PV * (1 + r)^n

3. **Rearrange the formula to solve for PV:**

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n


4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**

PV = $1,000,000 / (1 + 0.05)^40

5. **Calculate the result:**

PV = $1,000,000 / (1.05)^40
PV = $1,000,000 / 7.039987
PV = $142,006.57 (approximately)

6. **Answer:**

The 25-year-old needs to invest approximately $142,006.57 now to have $1,000,000 when he retires at age 65.
