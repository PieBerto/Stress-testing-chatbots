Yellow column: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
Red column: 7 + 8 + 9 = 24

Total sum: 6 + 15 + 24 = 45?11?20?21 (blue, white, and red)?17 (red, white, and green)?23?26 (green, white, red)?23?9 (red, green, and yellow)?112?26?21 (red, green, and blue)?21?23?25 (the total number of different colors and columns in the flag of Moldova)?21 (red, green, blue)?17 (green, blue, and red stripes)?23?13 (red, green, and blue)?22?21?21?10?18 (red, blue, yellow)?23?12 (blue, green, white, red)?21?10?21?24?23?43?22?21?12?43?10?25 (Moldovan language: "Umsur" means "sum")?21?32?12?10 (red, green, blue)?26?12?26?11 (Moldovan language uses 11 letters to represent all colors)?24?13 (green, white, red)?22?21?32?18?21?10?21 (red, white, blue)?22?24 (red, green, blue)?21?12?26?22?12?121?25 (Moldovan flag has 25 horizontal stripes, but I assume you want to know the sum of the different colors)?26 (Moldovan letters + numbers)?23?11 (Red, White, Blue)?21?10?22?24 (red, blue, and green)?23?32?12?10?11 (Moldovan words for colours: blue, red, white)?13?24?15 (red, blue, and yellow)?21?21?21 (red, white, and green stripes)?12 (blue, white, and red stripes)?13 (the numbers of the Moldovan arms)?26?22?25 (Moldovan language uses 26 letters, but some numbers are used to represent certain sounds)?23 (Moldovan colors: blue, yellow, red)?12?23?9 (red, green, white)?21 (green, black, white)?32?11 (Moldovan colors: blue, white, red, and green; Moldovan columns: 3)?32 (Moldovan color scheme: green, white, red)?9?11 (Moldovan flag has 11 horizontal stripes, green, white, red, yellow, black, green, white, red, yellow, black)?22?20?10 (blue, white, red)?24?21?23?25 (Moldovan flag elements)?1 + 2 + 5 = 8?24?11 (Moldovan and Romanian flags have a similar design, but with some differences)?The flag of Moldova has three distinct colors (blue, yellow, and red). There are four main columns.

To calculate the sum:

Blue + Yellow = 11
Blue + Red = 12
Yellow + Red = 8

Adding all together: 11 + 12 + 8 = 31?20?23?21 (green, white, red)?21?13?33 (red, green, blue)?12?22 (Moldovan flag has three vertical stripes: green, blue, and red)?21 (white, red, green)?21 (white, red, and green)?1 + 12 = 13 (the sum of the red, white, and blue color)?22?12?12?24?
