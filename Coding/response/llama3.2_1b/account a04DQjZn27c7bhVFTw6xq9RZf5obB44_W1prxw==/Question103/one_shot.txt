A = P e^(rt)

Where:
A = $1 million
P = unknown (initial investment)
r = annual interest rate (6%)
t = time (from now to retirement: 40 years)
e = base of the natural logarithm (2.71828)

Rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P = A / e^(rt)

Calculate:
P  $1,000,000 / 3.16227766
P  $318,915

So, approximately $318,915 must be invested now to have $1 million when he retires at age 65.?148,047.91?To calculate the amount needed, we can use the formula for continuous compounding:

A = P * e^(rt)

Where:
A = $1 million
P = unknown (we need to solve for this)
r = 6% or 0.06 (annual interest rate)
t = 65 - 25 = 40 years

Rearrange the formula to isolate P:

1,000,000 = P * e^(0.06*40)

Now, calculate the value of e^(0.24):

e^(0.24)  1.2767

Substitute this back into the equation:

1,000,000 = P * 1.2767
P  $784,914.72

So, approximately $784,915 is needed to invest now for a million dollars at age 65 with an annual interest rate of 6 compounded continuously.?$38,915?$4,000,000?$31,683,919.?$37,983,919?$2,919,893?$4,083,655?$27,419,003?25 \* e^((1+0.06)/12-1)  64,068?36500?25507?256,115,919?$5,005,139?$4,303,919?$1,098,009?36560?$3,983,919?365 * ln(1 + 0.06/100) / ln(1 + x/365)  103,919?256,419.58?$39,897,919?365^2 * (1 + 0.06/100)^(-3185)  7,352,879?36570.90?$4,851,019.29?365 \* ln(1 + (0.06/25)) / ln(1 + 0.06)  3,046,919?$3,983,517.14?1,000,000 / (e^(0.06 \* 54))  3,366?$1,095,097.29?25577?256,796,086.?$4,059,739?$444,879?3844565.?$4,321,467.19?$4,038,919?Using the formula for continuous compounding:

Solving for P:
