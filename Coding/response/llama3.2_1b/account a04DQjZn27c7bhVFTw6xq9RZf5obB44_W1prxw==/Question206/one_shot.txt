Explanation: Yawning in response to waking up is a natural reflex, as it helps increase oxygen flow and wakefulness. However, yawning during sleep might be related to stress or discomfort, which could be alleviated by getting out of bed and moving around before yawning.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine states that yawning can occur during sleep as well as wakefulness, and it's not related to the person's awareness or control over their yawns.

Explanation: The phenomenon of yawning can have various causes and effects on the body. When awake, yawning may be a natural reflex or a way to regulate breathing. When asleep, yawning is more likely to occur due to the increased brain activity and oxygenation during sleep.?1. True

Explanation: Yawning can be a sign of alertness or stress, and it's common for people to yawn when they're awake because their brain is trying to regulate its temperature and circadian rhythms. This behavior is not directly linked to sleep.?1. True?1. True?1. True (yawning can help increase oxygen flow and wakefulness in sleepers)?1. True (it's a common phenomenon)?1. True

Yawning during sleep can be a natural reflex, and it's not necessarily related to the individual's will or control over their body functions. It may simply be an automatic response to stress, fatigue, or other stimuli that occur when falling asleep.?1. True?1. True?1. True?1. True

Yawning can help increase oxygen flow to the brain, which may have a calming effect on the body. It's also possible that yawning helps to reduce stress and promote relaxation before sleep.?1. True?1.
