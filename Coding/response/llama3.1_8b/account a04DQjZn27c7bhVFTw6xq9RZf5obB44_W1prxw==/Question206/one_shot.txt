This is a reference to a paradox by Albert Einstein.?2?2?2?1.?3?2?3?2?1.?3?1?2?2?3?2?3?3?3?3?2?2?1.?1?3?1?3?2 

This statement cannot be true because it describes a preference rather than a factual condition.?3?2.?1?3?3 

(This statement cannot be verified or denied without more information about your personal preferences.)?2?2?1?2 

Yawning after waking up and yawning before falling asleep are two different experiences. It's subjective whether one prefers yawning upon waking or not, but it doesn't imply a contradiction in the statement itself. The speaker finds it appealing to yawn when waking up but not when falling asleep. This preference does not make the statement false; rather, it makes it a matter of personal taste.?3?2?2?3?2 

This response is based on the assumption that it's generally more pleasant to yawn when waking up rather than falling asleep.?3?3?2?2?3?1?2.?3?3?2?2?2?2?2?1?1?2?1?1.?2?2?1?2?2?2?2?1.?1?1?3?2?2?2?2?1.?2?1.?2?1?2?2?3?3

(The question is subjective and related to personal preferences)?2?1?2 

The person's preference for yawning when awake doesn't necessarily reflect its necessity or natural occurrence in both states.?3 

This is because the preference for yawning as soon as one wakes up or falls asleep is subjective and depends on individual perspectives. It's not a matter of truth or falsehood, but rather personal taste.?3?3

(This answer can be justified by observing that the speaker expresses a subjective preference for yawning when awake rather than asleep.)?2?3?3?3?2?2?2.?3?1?1?1.?2?1?1?2?2?2?2?2?2?1?2?1?3?2?2?1.?2?1.?1?1.?2?2.?1?1?2?2?3?1.?2?2?3?2?3?3?2?2?2?1?2?1?1?2?1.?1?2?1.?3 

Explanation: The first part of the sentence (yawning as soon as I am awake) expresses a preference or feeling, while the second part (yawning as soon as I am asleep does not appeal to me) also expresses a preference or feeling. Since both parts express subjective opinions and there is no objective truth being stated, the answer is "other".?3 

The speaker's preference for yawning in specific situations doesn't necessarily imply a universal truth about yawning. Their personal experience might not reflect what happens for everyone, so it can be neither true nor false without further information.?2?3?3?2?2?1?2?2?2?3?1?2?1?2?2?1?2?2?3?1?2?3?1?1.?2?2?3?2?1?2?2?2?2?1?1?2?1?1?2?1.?2?1?1?1.?3 

The reason behind this preference may vary from person to person and can be influenced by various factors such as sleep patterns, health, or personal preferences. It's not possible to determine the truth of this statement without knowing more about the individual making it. However, if we assume that the interlocutor is telling the truth, then we would consider the statement based on its content.?1?1.?1?2?1?1?3?2?2?1?2?1?2?1?2?2?3 

Explanation: The statement in the question is subjective and expresses a personal preference. It doesn't have an objective truth value.?2?2?1?2?1.?2?2?2?1?3?2?1?1?2?1?3?3?2?2?1?3?1?3 

(This statement is subjective and based on personal preference)?2?2?1.?3?1?3?1?2?3?2?2?1?1?2?2?3?3?2 

The speaker's preference for yawning in certain situations is subjective and personal, but it doesn't necessarily contradict any objective truth about yawning.?3?2?3?1.?3?1?2?2?2?1.?1?3 

There is no logical connection between yawning at wake-up and sleep. A person can yawn when they are awake or asleep regardless of the other condition being true or false.?2?2?3?2?2?2?3 

(This statement cannot be verified or proven as true or false because it depends on personal preferences and experiences.)?2?2?1?2?2?3?2?2?3

(This statement can't be verified as true or false without more information about the speaker's preferences.)?2?3?1?3?1?3?3?1?1?
