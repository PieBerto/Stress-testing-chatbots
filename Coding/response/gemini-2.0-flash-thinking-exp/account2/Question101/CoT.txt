Solution:
Let $V_b$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_b = 40 cm^3$.
Let $N_i$ be the number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion. We are given that $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_b = (2^n - 1) \times V_b$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
Then, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_b$.
So, $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_b$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_b = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_b = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_b$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $n_{full}$ be the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
$V_{n_{full}} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{n_{full}} - 1) \times V_b = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_b$.
Divide both sides by $V_b$:
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find the number of insertions left after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium.
We need to find $n_{full} - 30$.
Since $2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $n_{full}$ is very close to 31.
If $n_{full} = 31$, then $2^{31} = 2^{31}$. And $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$.
So, let's check if $n_{full} = 31$.
If $n_{full} = 31$, the volume filled is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_b$.
The stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_b$.
Since $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$, it means that the stadium is filled between the 30th and 31st insertion, and it is filled at the 31st insertion or slightly before considering continuous fill.
Since we consider discrete insertions and at 30th insertion it is half full, we need to check how many more insertions are needed to reach full.
We are already at the 30th insertion. We need to find how many more insertions are needed to reach $n_{full} \approx 31$.
Number of insertions left = $n_{full} - 30 \approx 31 - 30 = 1$.
So, 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.
