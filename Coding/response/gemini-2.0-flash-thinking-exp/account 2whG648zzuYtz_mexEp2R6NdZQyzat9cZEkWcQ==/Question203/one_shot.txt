Therefore, there are 3 different colors in the stripes of the flag: blue, yellow, and red.

A column in the context of a flag typically refers to vertical stripes. The flag of Moldova has horizontal stripes, not vertical stripes.  Thus, the number of columns (vertical stripes) in the flag of Moldova is 0.

The sum of the different colors and columns is therefore 3 (colors) + 0 (columns) = 3.
