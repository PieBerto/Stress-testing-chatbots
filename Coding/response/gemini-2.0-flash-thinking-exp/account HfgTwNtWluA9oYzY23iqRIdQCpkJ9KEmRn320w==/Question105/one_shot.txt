Let $P(t)$ be the population after $t$ years, with $P(0) = 60,000,000$.
Let $B(t)$ be the number of births in year $t$, with $B(0) = 350,000$ and $B(t) = 350,000 - 30,000t$ for $t \ge 1$.
Let $D(t)$ be the number of deaths in year $t$, with $D(t) = 350,000$ for all $t \ge 1$.
The population change in year $t$ is $P(t) - P(t-1) = B(t-1) - D(t-1)$ for $t \ge 1$.
For $1 \le t \le 12$, $B(t-1) = 350,000 - 30,000(t-1)$.
$P(t) - P(t-1) = 350,000 - 30,000(t-1) - 350,000 = -30,000(t-1)$ for $1 \le t \le 12$.
$P(12) = P(0) + \sum_{t=1}^{12} (P(t) - P(t-1)) = P(0) + \sum_{t=1}^{12} -30,000(t-1) = 60,000,000 - 30,000 \sum_{j=0}^{11} j = 60,000,000 - 30,000 \frac{11 \times 12}{2} = 60,000,000 - 30,000 \times 66 = 60,000,000 - 1,980,000 = 58,020,000$.
For $t \ge 13$, assume births are 0, $B(t-1) = 0$.
$P(t) - P(t-1) = 0 - 350,000 = -350,000$ for $t \ge 13$.
$P(n) = P(12) + \sum_{t=13}^n (P(t) - P(t-1)) = P(12) + \sum_{t=13}^n -350,000 = P(12) - 350,000(n-12)$ for $n \ge 13$.
We want to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $P(n) \le 30,000,000$.
$P(n) = 58,020,000 - 350,000(n-12) \le 30,000,000$.
$58,020,000 - 30,000,000 \le 350,000(n-12)$.
$28,020,000 \le 350,000(n-12)$.
$n-12 \ge \frac{28,020,000}{350,000} = \frac{2802}{35} \approx 80.057$.
$n \ge 12 + 80.057 = 92.057$.
Since $n$ must be integer, the smallest integer $n$ is 93.
