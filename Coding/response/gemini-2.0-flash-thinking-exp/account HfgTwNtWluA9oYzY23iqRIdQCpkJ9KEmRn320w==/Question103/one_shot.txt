How much must he invest now to have $1 million when he retires at age 65

Let P be the principal amount (the amount to invest now).
Let r be the annual interest rate, which is 6% or 0.06.
Let t be the number of years the money is invested.
Let A be the amount after t years, which is $1 million.

The person is currently 25 years old and retires at age 65.
The number of years of investment is t = 65 - 25 = 40 years.
The annual interest rate is r = 6% = 0.06.
The desired amount at retirement is A = $1,000,000.

The formula for continuous compound interest is A = Pe^(rt).
We need to find P.
Given A = 1,000,000, r = 0.06, t = 40.
1,000,000 = Pe^(0.06 * 40)
1,000,000 = Pe^(2.4)

To solve for P, divide both sides by e^(2.4):
P = 1,000,000 / e^(2.4)

Using a calculator, e^(2.4)  11.02317638.
P = 1,000,000 / 11.02317638
P  90,717.95329

Rounding to two decimal places for currency:
P  90,717.95

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{90717.95}$?90717.95?90717.95?90717.95?90717.95?90717.95?90717.95?90717.95?90717.95?The problem involves continuous compound interest, and we need to find the principal amount needed to reach a future value.
The formula for continuous compound interest is given by:
A = Pe^(rt)
Where:
A = the future value of the investment
P = the principal amount (the initial investment)
r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
t = the time in years

In this problem, we are given:
A = $1,000,000 (the desired amount at retirement)
r = 6% = 0.06 (annual interest rate)
The person is currently 25 years old and will retire at age 65, so the time period is:
t = 65 - 25 = 40 years

We need to find the principal amount P. We can rearrange the formula to solve for P:
P = A / e^(rt)

Substitute the given values into the formula:
P = 1,000,000 / e^(0.06 * 40)
P = 1,000,000 / e^(2.4)

Now we need to calculate the value of e^(2.4). Using a calculator, we find:
e^(2.4)  11.023176375

Now, we can calculate P:
P = 1,000,000 / 11.023176375
P  90717.95329

Since we are dealing with money, it is appropriate to round the answer to two decimal places (cents).
P  90717.95

Therefore, the person must invest approximately $90,717.95 now to have $1 million when he retires at age 65.

We are asked to answer only with the number that solves the problem and nothing more.
The number that solves the problem is 90717.95 (rounded to two decimal places).
