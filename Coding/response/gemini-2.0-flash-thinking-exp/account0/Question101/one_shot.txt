$V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of the volumes of golf balls from insertion 1 to insertion $n$:
$$V_n = v \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = v (1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1})$$
This is a geometric series with first term $a=1$, common ratio $r=2$, and $n$ terms. The sum is given by $\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r-1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2-1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, the total volume after $n$ insertions is $V_n = v(2^n - 1)$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, $V_{30} = \frac{V}{2}$.
$$V_{30} = v(2^{30} - 1) = \frac{V}{2}$$
Thus, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2v(2^{30} - 1)$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions required after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions is $30+k$. We want to find $k$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V$.
$$V_{30+k} = v(2^{30+k} - 1)$$
We want to find the smallest integer $k \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V$.
$$v(2^{30+k} - 1) \ge 2v(2^{30} - 1)$$
Divide both sides by $v$:
$$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2(2^{30} - 1)$$
$$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$$
$$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$$
We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
If $k=1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. Since $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$, the condition is satisfied for $k=1$.
If $k=0$, then $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$. Since $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$, the condition is not satisfied for $k=0$.
Therefore, the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k=1$.
So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Final answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the volume of the stadium and v be the volume of a golf ball, where v = 40 cm^3.
In each insertion, the number of golf balls inserted doubles.
Insertion 1: 1 ball
Insertion 2: 2 balls
Insertion 3: 4 balls
...
Insertion n: 2^(n-1) balls

The total number of balls inserted after n insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = 2^n - 1

The volume occupied by the golf balls after n insertions is V_n = N_n * v = (2^n - 1) * v.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
V_30 = (2^30 - 1) * v = V / 2
From this, we can find the full volume of the stadium:
V = 2 * V_30 = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v = (2 * 2^30 - 2) * v = (2^31 - 2) * v

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium, starting from the 30th insertion. Let's consider the volume after 30 + x insertions:
V_(30+x) = (2^(30+x) - 1) * v

We want to find the smallest integer x such that V_(30+x) is equal to or greater than V. For the stadium to be exactly filled, we need V_(30+x) = V.
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v = (2^31 - 2) * v
Divide both sides by v:
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2^31 - 2
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 1

Let's check for x=1:
2^(30+1) = 2^31
2^31 vs 2^31 - 1
2^31 > 2^31 - 1
This means that if we add 1 more insertion (so total 31 insertions), the volume occupied will be V_31 = (2^31 - 1) * v, which is slightly greater than V = (2^31 - 2) * v.
Thus, just one more insertion is sufficient to fill the stadium.

The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Rationale:
Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume filled after 30 insertions is half of the stadium's volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the volume filled after $x$ insertions should be equal to the stadium's volume:
$V_x = (2^x - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^x - 1) V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^x - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^x - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^x - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^x = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^x = 2^{31} - 1$

Since $2^{31}$ is a very large number, $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$. For integer values of $x$, if $2^x = 2^{31} - 1$, then $x$ must be very close to 31. If we consider $x=31$, then $2^{31} - 1$ is indeed the value we are looking for. So $x = 31$ is the number of insertions to fill the stadium.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion.
Number of insertions left = Total insertions to fill - Insertions already done
Number of insertions left = $x - 30 = 31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Rationale:
Let $V$ be the volume of the stadium and $v = 40 cm^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
The number of balls inserted at each insertion follows a geometric progression: $1, 2, 4, 8, \dots, 2^{n-1}$ for the $n$-th insertion.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times v = (2^n - 1) v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) v = \frac{1}{2} V$.
Thus, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) v = (2^{31} - 2) v$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Then we are looking for the total number of insertions $N = 30 + k$ such that the stadium is at least full.
The volume occupied after $N = 30 + k$ insertions is $V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) v$.
We want to find the smallest integer $k \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V$.
$(2^{30+k} - 1) v \ge (2^{31} - 2) v$.
Dividing by $v$ (since $v > 0$):
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $k=1$. Then $30+k = 31$.
$2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is true.
So, $k=1$ is sufficient.
Let's check for $k=0$. Then $30+k = 30$.
$2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
$2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$. This is false.
So, we need at least $k=1$ additional insertion.
Thus, we need exactly 1 more insertion to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill it).
The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $N_i = 2^{i-1}$ balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then,
$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$, we have:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We can check what happens at the 31st insertion.
Number of balls in 31st insertion is $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$.
Volume added in 31st insertion is $2^{30} V_{ball}$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = V_{30} + 2^{30} V_{ball} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} + 2^{30} V_{ball} = (2^{30} - 1 + 2^{30}) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
The stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} > V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
So, after the 31st insertion, the stadium is already filled (and slightly overfilled).
Since at the 30th insertion the stadium is half full, only one more insertion is needed to fill it.
Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the volume occupied by golf balls after the n-th insertion.
The number of golf balls inserted at each step follows a geometric progression: $1, 2, 4, 8, \dots, 2^{n-1}$ for the n-th insertion.
The total number of golf balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of this geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume occupied by these balls is $V_n = N_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$, where $v = 40 cm^3$ is the volume of a single golf ball.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means $V_{30} = \frac{V}{2}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{V}{2}$
So, the total volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $m$ be the total number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then $V_m = V$.
$V_m = (2^m - 1) \times v = V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$
Dividing both sides by $v$:
$2^m - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^m - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^m - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 1$

Since $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $m \approx 31$.
Let's consider the volume added at each step.
At the 30th insertion, it's half full.
At the 31st insertion, we add $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$ balls.
The volume added at the 31st insertion is $2^{30} \times v$.
The remaining volume to be filled after the 30th insertion is $V - V_{30} = V - \frac{V}{2} = \frac{V}{2} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
We need to find how many more insertions are needed to add at least the remaining volume $\frac{V}{2}$.
At the 31st insertion, the volume added is $2^{30} \times v$.
Since $2^{30} \times v > (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{V}{2}$, the volume added in just one more insertion (the 31st insertion) is already more than the remaining volume needed to fill the stadium.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.

Number of insertions left = $m - 30$.
Since $2^{30} \times v > V/2$, we know that by insertion 31, the stadium will be full (actually overfull).
Thus, only 1 insertion is left to fill it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times 40 \text{cm}^3$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40$.
Therefore, $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{cm}^3$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions required after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium.
So, we need to find $x$ such that after $30+x$ insertions, the stadium is full.
$V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40$.
We set $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40$.
Divide both sides by 40:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We can check for integer values of $x$.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. And $2^{31} - 1 < 2^{31}$.
So, $2^{30+1} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
This means that for $x=1$, $2^{30+1} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
And we want $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
Let's check if $x=1$ works.
For $x=1$, number of insertions is $30+1=31$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40$.
Stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40 - (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 = (2^{31} - 1 - (2^{31} - 2)) \times 40 = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) \times 40 = 1 \times 40 = 40$.
$V_{31} = V_{stadium} + 40$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled by the volume of one golf ball.
Since at 30th insertion, the stadium is half full, and at 31st insertion, it is slightly over full, it means that 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The cumulative number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $C_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume filled after $n$ insertions is $V_{filled\_n} = C_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{filled\_30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{filled\_30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions required to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. The total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the volume filled after $30+x$ insertions is greater than or equal to the stadium volume.
$V_{filled\_(30+x)} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We need to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{filled\_(30+x)} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So, $x=1$ is sufficient.
Let's check for $x=0$.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.
Therefore, the smallest integer $x$ is 1.

The number of insertions left to fill the stadium is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium completely after the 30th insertion. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + k$.
The volume after $30 + k$ insertions is $V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $k \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $k=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So, $k=1$ is sufficient.
Let's check for $k=0$.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, it is not.
So, we need at least $k=1$ additional insertion.

Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Rationale:
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions.
We are given that the volume of a golf ball is $v = 40 cm^3$.
In the $k$-th insertion, $2^{k-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
So, after $n$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume occupied after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1)v$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2(2^{30} - 1)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$.
We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium, i.e., to reach volume $V_{stadium}$. Let $n$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then we need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $V_n \ge V_{stadium}$.
$V_n = (2^n - 1)v \ge V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2)v$.
Dividing by $v$, we get $2^n - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
We need to find the smallest integer $n$ satisfying this inequality.
Since $2^{31} - 1 < 2^{31}$, we can choose $n = 31$.
For $n = 31$, $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$.
Since $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$ and $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2)v$, we have $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is filled (actually slightly overfilled).
We have already made 30 insertions. So we need to make $31 - 30 = 1$ more insertion to fill the stadium.
Therefore, there is 1 insertion left to fill it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^{j} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium. Then, the volume filled after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the total volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $m$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the volume filled after $m$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_m = (2^m - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$, we get:
$2^m - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^m = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^m = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked to find how many more insertions are needed after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find $x$ such that the stadium is full after $30 + x$ insertions.
We know that at 30 insertions, the stadium is half full. Let's consider the next insertion, the 31st insertion.
At the 31st insertion, the total volume filled will be $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ with $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$, we see that $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} - (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) V_{ball} = 1 \times V_{ball} = V_{ball}$.
This means that after the 31st insertion, the stadium is overfilled by the volume of one golf ball.
Since the stadium is half full at the 30th insertion and slightly overfull at the 31st insertion, it means we need only 1 more insertion to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.
Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Final Answer: 1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half the volume of the stadium:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the volume of the stadium is:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $n$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$, we get:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x = n$.
We want to find $x = n - 30$.
Since $2^n = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $n$ is very close to 31.
Let's check for $n=31$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} - (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) V_{ball} = 1 \times V_{ball}$.
After 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled by the volume of one golf ball. However, since at 30 insertions it is half full and the number of balls doubles with each insertion, it is logical that just one more insertion will be needed to fill the remaining half.

The number of insertions left to fill it is $n - 30$. As $n$ is approximately 31, $x = n - 30 \approx 31 - 30 = 1$.
Let's check the increase in volume from 30th to 31st insertion.
Volume at 30th insertion is $(2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Volume at 31st insertion is $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Difference = $V_{31} - V_{30} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} - (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{30} + 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2^{30}) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2^{30}) V_{ball} = 2^{30} V_{ball}$.
The remaining volume at 30th insertion is $V_{stadium} - V_{30} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball} - (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2 - 2^{30} + 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
The volume added in the 31st insertion is $2^{30} V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$, the 31st insertion will fill the stadium.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions.
In the $k$-th insertion, $2^{k-1}$ golf balls are inserted, and each golf ball has a volume of $40 cm^3$.
So, in the $k$-th insertion, the volume of golf balls inserted is $2^{k-1} \times 40 cm^3$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of the volumes inserted in each insertion from 1 to $n$:
$V_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2^{k-1} \times 40) = 40 \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} = 40 \times (1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1})$
The sum of the geometric series $1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1}$ is $\frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, $V_n = 40 \times (2^n - 1)$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = 40 \times (2^{30} - 1) = \frac{V}{2}$
We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} = V$.
$V_{30+x} = 40 \times (2^{30+x} - 1) = V$
From $V_{30} = \frac{V}{2}$, we have $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times 40 \times (2^{30} - 1) = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
Now set $V_{30+x} = V$:
$40 \times (2^{30+x} - 1) = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
Divide both sides by 40:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find integer $x$.
Let's consider integer values for $x$.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
We have $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
$2^{31} = 2^{31} - 1$ is not true. But $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{30+x}$ must be slightly less than $2^{31}$, we must have $30+x$ slightly less than $31$. But $x$ must be a positive integer.

Let's check the volume at insertion 31.
$V_{31} = 40 \times (2^{31} - 1) = 40 \times (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) = 80 \times 2^{30} - 40 = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1 + 1) - 40 = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1) + 80 - 40 = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1) + 40 = V + 40$.
Since $V = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1)$, $V_{31} = V + 40$.
$V_{30} = V/2$.
$V_{31} = V + 40$.
Since $V_{30} = V/2$ and $V_{31} = V + 40$, it means that after one more insertion (the 31st insertion in total, or 1 insertion after the 30th), the stadium is filled and slightly overfilled by the volume of 40 cm$^3$, which is exactly the volume of one golf ball.
Since we are asked for the number of insertions left to fill it, and at insertion 31 the stadium is filled (and slightly overfilled), it means that 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $N_i = 2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

Let $n$ be the total number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then $V_n = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^n - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Divide both sides by $40 \text{ cm}^3$:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let this number be $x$.
Then the total number of insertions to fill the stadium is $30 + x$.
So, $n = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

However, we observe that $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$.
If we approximate $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$, then $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$, which implies $30+x \approx 31$, so $x \approx 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$. Total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
Volume after 31 insertions $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Stadium volume $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
The volume after 31 insertions is slightly more than the stadium volume.
Since at 30 insertions it was half full, and at 31 it is slightly over full, it means that just 1 more insertion is needed to fill it.

Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let V be the volume of the stadium and v be the volume of a golf ball.
The number of golf balls inserted at the nth insertion is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after n insertions is $V_n = S_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{30}$ be the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
We are given that $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$.
So, $\frac{1}{2} V = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n$ be the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
We need to find $n$ such that $V_n = V$.
$(2^n - 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^n - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^n - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$

We are asked how many insertions are LEFT to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} = V$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times v = V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We know that $2^{30}$ balls fill half of the stadium approximately (slightly less due to -1).
In the 31st insertion, we add $2^{30}$ balls. This amount is approximately the same as the total balls already inserted in the first 30 insertions that filled half the stadium. So, one more insertion should be sufficient to fill the remaining half.

Let's check for $x=1$. Total insertions = $30 + 1 = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$.
Stadium volume $V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times v = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$
$V = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$
$V_{31} > V$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled. However, since at 30th insertion it is half full, and with the next insertion (31st), it becomes full (or slightly more), it means only 1 more insertion is needed to fill it.

Number of insertions left to fill it = 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?ANSWER: 1?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let v be the volume of a golf ball, approximately 40 cm^3.
The number of balls inserted in each insertion follows a geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, 8, ... , 2^(n-1) in the n-th insertion.
The total number of balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of this geometric series:
Sum_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = (2^n - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^n - 1.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after n insertions is V_n = (2^n - 1) * v.

Given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means the volume occupied after 30 insertions is V/2.
V/2 = V_30 = (2^30 - 1) * v.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is V = 2 * V/2 = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium from the 30th insertion onwards. Let x be the number of additional insertions needed. So, the total number of insertions will be 30 + x.
The volume occupied after 30 + x insertions is V_(30+x) = (2^(30+x) - 1) * v.
To fill the stadium, we need V_(30+x) = V.
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v.
Divide both sides by v:
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * (2^30 - 1)
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * 2^30 - 2
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2^(31) - 2
2^(30+x) = 2^(31) - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) = 2^(31) - 1

Let's consider the volume added in each insertion after the 30th insertion.
Volume at 30th insertion = V/2.
Volume added in the 31st insertion = 2^(31-1) * v = 2^30 * v.
If we add the volume added in the 31st insertion to the volume at the 30th insertion:
V_31 = V_30 + 2^30 * v = (2^30 - 1) * v + 2^30 * v = (2^30 - 1 + 2^30) * v = (2 * 2^30 - 1) * v = (2^31 - 1) * v.
We know V = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v = (2^(31) - 2) * v.
V_31 = (2^31 - 1) * v.
Since V_31 = (2^31 - 1) * v and V = (2^31) - 2) * v, we have V_31 > V.
This means that after only 1 additional insertion (the 31st insertion), the stadium becomes more than full.
Therefore, only 1 insertion is left to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v$ be the volume of a golf ball, $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1) v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) v = \frac{1}{2} V$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) v$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the number of insertions to fill the stadium.
The volume after $N$ insertions is $V_N = (2^N - 1) v$.
For the stadium to be full, we need $V_N = V$.
$(2^N - 1) v = 2 (2^{30} - 1) v$.
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^N - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^N - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2$
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion.
Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the stadium is filled after $30+x$ insertions.
Volume after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) v$.
We want $V_{30+x} \ge V = 2 (2^{30} - 1) v$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) v \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1) v$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$. Total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) v$.
Is $V_{31} \ge V$
$(2^{31} - 1) v \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1) v$
$2^{31} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$-1 \ge -2$, which is true.
So, after 31 insertions the stadium is full (or overfull).
Since at 30 insertions it is half full, we need just 1 more insertion to fill the stadium.
Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After $n$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of additional insertions, let's say $x$, needed to fill the stadium completely. So we want to find $x$ such that after $30+x$ insertions, the stadium is full.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to solve for $x$. We can take logarithm base 2 on both sides:
$30+x = \log_2(2^{31} - 1)$
$x = \log_2(2^{31} - 1) - 30$
We know that $\log_2(2^{31}) = 31$. Since $2^{31} - 1$ is slightly less than $2^{31}$, $\log_2(2^{31} - 1)$ will be slightly less than 31.
Let's approximate $\log_2(2^{31} - 1) \approx 31$.
Then $x \approx 31 - 30 = 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$. Number of insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$
We need $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Since $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} > (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$, one more insertion is slightly more than enough to fill the stadium.
However, we are looking for the number of insertions left to fill it. Since 1 insertion makes it slightly overfull, and 0 is not enough, and we must provide an integer answer, the closest integer and the first integer that fills or exceeds is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $N_i = 2^{i-1}$ balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x$.
The volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

If $x = 1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
If $x = 0$, $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$. Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.

Therefore, the smallest integer $x$ is 1.
So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $N_i$ be the number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion. We are given that $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $T_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = T_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, the volume of balls after 30 insertions is half the volume of the stadium, $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + k$.
The volume of balls after $30+k$ insertions is $V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
For the stadium to be full, we need $V_{30+k} \ge V_{stadium}$. Let's find when $V_{30+k} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 1$

Let's consider the volume filled after each additional insertion starting from the 30th insertion.
After 30 insertions, stadium is half full. We need to fill the remaining half.
Volume of remaining half = $V_{stadium} / 2 = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Volume inserted at 31st insertion = $2^{31-1} \times V_{ball} = 2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} \times V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$, the volume inserted at the 31st insertion is more than the remaining volume needed to fill the stadium.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.
Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In each insertion $i$, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.

The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$Total\_balls(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1}$
This is a geometric series with first term $a = 1$, common ratio $r = 2$, and $n$ terms.
The sum of a geometric series is given by $S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}$.
In our case, $S_n = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, $Total\_balls(n) = 2^n - 1$.

The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is:
$V_{balls}(n) = Total\_balls(n) \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{balls}(30) = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{balls}(30) = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $m$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
$V_{balls}(m) = (2^m - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^m - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^m - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^m - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^m - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 1$

We can observe that if $m = 31$, then $V_{balls}(31) = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
This matches exactly with the required volume $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Wait, there was a mistake in the last step.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find $m$ such that $V_{balls}(m) = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^m - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
$2^m - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 1$

Actually, the volume at insertion 31 is $V_{balls}(31) = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
And we found $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
There was a mistake somewhere. Let's re-read the question.

"If at the 30th insertion the stage is exactly half full".
So, volume at 30th insertion is half.
$V_{balls}(30) = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find how many *more* insertions are left to fill it. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions.
Total insertions will be $30 + x$.
$V_{balls}(30 + x) = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

Let's check for $x=1$. Total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
$V_{balls}(31) = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Is this equal to $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$
Yes, because $V_{balls}(31) = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$ and $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
This is not exactly the same. There is a slight difference of $V_{ball}$.

Let's re-examine the doubling aspect.
At 30th insertion, it is half full.
In the next insertion (31st), the number of balls inserted is $2^{30}$.
Volume added in 31st insertion is $2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
Volume at 30th insertion was $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Volume at 31st insertion = Volume at 30th insertion + Volume added in 31st insertion
$= \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} + 2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
We know $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Volume at 31st insertion $= (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} + 2^{30} \times V_{ball} = (2^{30} - 1 + 2^{30}) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
And we defined $V_{balls}(31) = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
So, at 31st insertion, the stadium becomes full.
We are at 30th insertion. Number of insertions left is $31 - 30 = 1$.

The number of balls added at each step doubles. If at step 30, it is half full, then in step 31, we add as much volume as was already present at step 30 plus the small volume of the very first insertions which are negligible compared to the 30th insertion.
If at insertion 30, volume is H, in insertion 31, we add approximately H volume (more precisely, we add $2^{30} V_{ball}$ and previous volume is $(2^{30}-1) V_{ball}$ so added volume is slightly more than previous).
So, one more insertion will fill the remaining half (approximately, and exactly in this geometric progression case).

Number of insertions left is 1.

Final Answer: 1.
Let's verify again:
Volume after 30 insertions is $V_{30} = (2^{30}-1)V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2(2^{30}-1)V_{ball}$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31}-1)V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1)V_{ball} = (2^{30} + 2^{30} - 1)V_{ball} = (2^{30}-1)V_{ball} + 2^{30}V_{ball} = V_{30} + 2^{30}V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31}-1)V_{ball} = (2^{31}-2+1)V_{ball} = (2(2^{30}-1)+1)V_{ball} = 2(2^{30}-1)V_{ball} + V_{ball} = V_{stadium} + V_{ball}$.
This is slightly more than $V_{stadium}$.

Let's re-check the question statement. "If at the 30th insertion the stage is exactly half full". It means at the end of the 30th insertion, the volume occupied is exactly half of the stadium volume.
So, we calculated $V_{balls}(30) = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{balls}(30+x) = V_{stadium}$.
$V_{balls}(30+x) = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

If $x=1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $30+x$ must be slightly less than 31, but because number of insertions must be integer, we need to consider the next integer.
If we take $x=1$, then we have done 31 insertions.
$V_{balls}(31) = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
$V_{balls}(31) > V_{stadium}$.
Actually, we need to find how many *more* insertions are left to *fill* it. If at 31 insertions it is already more than full, then the stadium must be full at exactly 31 insertions or even earlier.
However, we need to find the number of *more* insertions *left* to fill it.

If at 30th insertion it is half full, at 31st insertion it will be more than full.
The question is asking for the number of insertions *left* to fill it.
Since at 30th it's half full, and in the next insertion we add a bit more than the previous total volume, it must be 1 more insertion to fill it.

Let's consider if it is asking for the *minimum integer* number of insertions to fill it.
If after 30 insertions it is half full, then after 1 more insertion, it will be more than full. So, 1 more insertion is enough to fill it.

Number of insertions left = 1.

Let's check if it is exactly half full at 30th and exactly full at 31st.
If at 30th it is exactly half full, then volume at 30 is $H$. Full volume is $2H$.
Volume added at 31st insertion is $2^{30} V_{ball}$.
Volume at 30th insertion is $(2^{30}-1)V_{ball} = H$.
$H = (2^{30}-1)V_{ball}$.
Volume added at 31st is $2^{30}V_{ball}$.
Volume at 31st is $H + 2^{30}V_{ball} = (2^{30}-1)V_{ball} + 2^{30}V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1)V_{ball} = (2^{31}-1)V_{ball}$.
Full volume is $2H = 2(2^{30}-1)V_{ball} = (2^{31}-2)V_{ball}$.
Volume at 31st is $V_{31} = (2^{31}-1)V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31}-1)V_{ball} - (2^{31}-2)V_{ball} = V_{ball}$.
At 31st insertion, stadium is overfilled by exactly one golf ball volume.
But the question asks when it is filled. It is filled between 30th and 31st insertion, and first time it is filled is at the 31st insertion (or infinitesimally before end of 31st insertion if we consider continuous filling).
Number of additional insertions needed after 30th to fill it = 1.Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, given as $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted in the $i$-th insertion. We are given that the number of balls inserted doubles with each insertion, starting with 1 ball in the first insertion. So, $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.

The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$TotalBalls(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.

The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is:
$V_{balls}(k) = TotalBalls(k) \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of balls after 30 insertions is half the volume of the stadium ($V_{stadium}$).
$V_{balls}(30) = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{balls}(30) = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find $x$ such that the volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is equal to the volume of the stadium.
$V_{balls}(30 + x) = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30 + x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30 + x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30 + x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30 + x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30 + x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30 + x} = 2^{31} - 1$

If we consider $x = 1$, then $30 + x = 31$.
$2^{31} - 1$.
This exactly matches the right side of the equation.
So, $30 + x = 31$, which means $x = 31 - 30 = 1$.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Rationale:
Let $V$ be the volume of the stadium and $v = 40 cm^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
After $n$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1)v = (2^n - 1) \times 40 cm^3$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 = \frac{1}{2} V$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 cm^3$.
We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $N$ be the number of insertions needed to fill or exceed the volume of the stadium. We want to find the smallest integer $N$ such that $V_N \ge V$.
$V_N = (2^N - 1) \times 40 \ge V = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40$.
Dividing by 40, we get $2^N - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^N \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
We need to find the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality.
If we take $N = 31$, then $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$, which is true.
If we take $N = 30$, then $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ is false, since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{30} = 2^{30}$.
So, the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies the inequality is $N = 31$.
Thus, 31 insertions are needed to fill or exceed the volume of the stadium.
We are asked how many insertions are left to fill it after the 30th insertion.
Number of insertions left = Total insertions needed - Insertions already done = $N - 30 = 31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is approximately $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
The number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. This means we are looking at the total insertions as $30 + x$.
The total volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
For the stadium to be full, we need $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

Let's consider the volume added at each step.
At the 31st insertion, the number of balls added is $N_{31} = 2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$.
The volume added at the 31st insertion is $N_{31} \times V_{ball} = 2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
The remaining volume to be filled after 30 insertions is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} \times V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$, the remaining volume will be filled in the 31st insertion.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed.

To check if exactly one more insertion is enough:
After 30 insertions, volume is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
After 31 insertions, volume is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times 2^{30} \times V_{ball} - V_{ball}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times 2^{30} \times V_{ball} - 2 \times V_{ball}$.
Since $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$, the stadium is filled after the 31st insertion.
Since it was half full at 30th insertion, only one more insertion is needed to fill it.

The number of insertions left to fill it is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times v = (2^n - 1)v$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume occupied after 30 insertions is $V_{30} = \frac{V}{2}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{V}{2}$.
Therefore, the total volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)v$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + k$. We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that the volume occupied after $30 + k$ insertions is equal to or greater than the total volume $V$.
$V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1)v$.
We want $V_{30+k} \ge V$.
$(2^{30+k} - 1)v \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)v$.
Divide both sides by $v$ (since $v > 0$):
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality.
Let's test $k = 1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, because $2^{31} - (2^{31} - 1) = 1 \ge 0$.
So, $k = 1$ is sufficient to fill the stadium. Since we are asked "how many insertions are left to fill it", and we found that 1 additional insertion is enough to fill it from half full to full, the answer is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion. We are given that $N_i = 2^{i-1}$ for $i \ge 1$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This means $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + k$.
We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that the volume after $30+k$ insertions is equal to or greater than $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find $k$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+k} - 1) V_{ball} \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$), we get:
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality.
Let's test $k=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ is true because $0 \ge -1$.
So, $k=1$ is sufficient.

Let's check $k=0$:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0$ and $2^{31} > 2^{30}$, so $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.

Thus, the smallest integer $k$ is 1.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is
$V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $n$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then we must have $V_n = V_{stadium}$.
$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find the integer $n$ that satisfies this equation.
Since $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $2^n \approx 2^{31}$, which gives $n \approx 31$.
Let's check if $n=31$ is the solution.
For $n=31$, $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We know $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that at the 31st insertion, the stadium becomes slightly overfull, but it is the first insertion at which the stadium is filled (or exceeded its capacity).

Since at the 30th insertion the stadium is half full, we need to find how many more insertions are needed to reach the full stadium.
We have already performed 30 insertions. We found that approximately 31 insertions are needed to fill the stadium.
So, the number of insertions left to fill it is $31 - 30 = 1$.

To verify this, consider that at insertion 30 it is half full. In the next insertion (31st), the number of balls added is $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$.
The total number of balls at insertion 30 is $2^{30} - 1$.
The number of balls added at insertion 31 is $2^{30}$.
The volume added at insertion 31 is larger than the volume already in the stadium at insertion 30 (approximately, for large numbers). Thus, it is expected that one more insertion will fill the remaining half and possibly slightly more.

Number of insertions left = $n - 30 = 31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, and let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. The volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions will be:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
For the stadium to be full, we need $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.
If we try $x = 1$, we get:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Comparing $2^{31}$ with $2^{31} - 1$, we see that $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
This means that if we take $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$, which is indeed greater than $2^{31} - 2$.
Thus, with $x=1$, $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$ which is greater than $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
So, one additional insertion is enough to fill the stadium.
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let v be the volume of a single golf ball, v = 40 cm^3.
In the n-th insertion, we insert 2^(n-1) golf balls.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions, V_n, is given by the sum of the volumes of balls inserted in each insertion from 1 to n.
V_n = (1 * v) + (2 * v) + (4 * v) + ... + (2^(n-1) * v)
V_n = v * (1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1))
The sum of the geometric series 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) is given by (2^n - 1).
So, V_n = v * (2^n - 1).

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
V_30 = V / 2
V_30 = v * (2^30 - 1)
So, V / 2 = v * (2^30 - 1)
V = 2 * v * (2^30 - 1)

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely. We are already at the 30th insertion. Let k be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions will be 30 + k.
We want to find k such that V_(30+k) >= V. Let's find when V_(30+k) = V to find the exact number of insertions to fill it.
V_(30+k) = v * (2^(30+k) - 1)
We want V_(30+k) = V.
v * (2^(30+k) - 1) = 2 * v * (2^30 - 1)
Divide both sides by v:
2^(30+k) - 1 = 2 * (2^30 - 1)
2^(30+k) - 1 = 2 * 2^30 - 2
2^(30+k) = 2 * 2^30 - 2 + 1
2^(30+k) = 2^(31) - 1

If we consider k=1, then 30+k = 31.
V_31 = v * (2^31 - 1)
V = 2 * v * (2^30 - 1) = v * (2 * (2^30 - 1)) = v * (2^31 - 2)
V_31 = v * (2^31 - 1) = V + v

Since V_31 = V + v, after the 31st insertion, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
Since at the 30th insertion the stadium is half full, and at the 31st insertion it becomes full (and slightly more), it means that only one more insertion is needed to fill the stadium from the point of the 30th insertion.
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_k = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the volume of golf balls after $N$ insertions must be equal to $V_{stadium}$.
$V_N = (2^N - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^N - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find how many insertions are left after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then $N = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
If we consider $x=1$, then $N = 31$.
$2^{31} = 2^{31}$. This is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{31} - 1$ is slightly less than $2^{31}$, $30+x$ must be slightly less than $31$. However, the number of insertions must be an integer.

Let's check if adding one more insertion fills the stadium.
After 30 insertions, the stadium is half full. To fill the stadium completely, we need to double the volume of golf balls currently in the stadium.
The number of balls added in the 31st insertion is $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$.
The number of balls after 30 insertions is $2^{30} - 1$.
If we add $2^{30}$ balls in the 31st insertion, the total number of balls becomes $(2^{30} - 1) + 2^{30} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
The volume of balls becomes $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We know $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Since $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} > (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$, the stadium will be slightly overfilled after the 31st insertion.
However, given the wording "how many insertions are left to fill it", it is asking for the number of additional insertions to exactly fill it or the first insertion at which it is full.
Since at 30th insertion it's half full, and the volume approximately doubles with each insertion, it takes just 1 more insertion to fill it.

Number of insertions left = $N - 30$. From $2^N = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $N$ is very close to 31.
Since we can only have integer insertions, and after 30 insertions it is half full, the next insertion (31st) will make it full or slightly overfull.
Given the doubling nature, it is expected that exactly one more insertion is needed to go from half full to full.

The question asks for the number of insertions left to fill it. If at 30th it is half full, then 1 more insertion is required to reach full capacity.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \, cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This means $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
Then $V_N = (2^N - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
Substituting the value of $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^N - 1) V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^N - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^N - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find how many insertions are left to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then $N = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
If $x = 1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Since $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$, $x=1$ is a very good approximation.
Let's check if after 1 more insertion (total 31 insertions) the stadium is filled.
At 31st insertion, the total volume is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
However, the question asks how many insertions are LEFT to fill it when it is half full at the 30th insertion. Since one more insertion makes it slightly overfull, and we are dealing with discrete insertions, it means that 1 more insertion is sufficient to fill it.

Number of insertions left = $N - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume filled after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the full volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n$ be the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the volume filled after $n$ insertions is $V_n = V_{stadium}$.
$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find how many insertions are left after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. So, the total number of insertions is $30 + x = n$.
We need to find $x = n - 30$.
We know that at 30th insertion, the stadium is half full. We need to fill the remaining half.
The volume added in the $(30+1) = 31$st insertion is $N_{31} \times V_{ball} = 2^{31-1} \times V_{ball} = 2^{30} V_{ball}$.
The remaining volume to fill after 30 insertions is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Since the volume added in the 31st insertion ($2^{30} V_{ball}$) is greater than the remaining volume ($ (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$), the stadium will be filled during the 31st insertion.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium.
Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v$ be the volume of a single golf ball, $v = 40 cm^3$.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume occupied by the golf balls after 30 insertions is half the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$
$(2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{1}{2} V$
$V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times v = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $M$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then, the volume occupied by the golf balls after $M$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume $V$:
$V_M = V$
$(2^M - 1) \times v = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^M - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^M = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^M = 2^{31} - 1$

Since $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, $M$ should be very close to 31. As $M$ must be an integer, we can check if $M = 31$.
If $M = 31$, then the volume occupied is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ with $V = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$, we see that $V_{31} > V$.
$V_{31} - V = (2^{31} - 1) \times v - (2^{31} - 2) \times v = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) \times v = 1 \times v = v$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled by the volume of one golf ball.

However, we are asked how many insertions are *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion when it is half full.
Since at the 30th insertion the stadium is half full, and at the 31st insertion it becomes slightly over full, it means that only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill it, which we assume means filling it for the purpose of this problem as we are dealing with discrete numbers of balls).
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume filled after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This means the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th to fill the stadium.
We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $V_k \ge V_{stadium}$. We know that at $k=30$, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.

Let's check the volume at the 31st insertion:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Compare $V_{31}$ with $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} - (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) V_{ball} = 1 \times V_{ball} = V_{ball}$.
Since $V_{31} = V_{stadium} + V_{ball}$, it means that at the 31st insertion, the stadium is already overfilled by the volume of one golf ball.

Since at the 30th insertion the stadium is half full, and at the 31st insertion the stadium is overfull, it means that we only need 1 more insertion after the 30th to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill it, as we cannot have a fraction of insertion).
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill the stadium is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In each insertion, the number of balls inserted doubles.
Number of balls inserted in the $n$-th insertion is $2^{n-1}$.
Cumulative number of balls after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$C_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = C_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium from the state at the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

If we choose $x = 1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This inequality holds.
If we choose $x = 0$, then $30+x = 30$.
$2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This inequality does not hold because $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.

So, the smallest integer $x$ is $1$. This means that only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
The number of balls inserted at each insertion $n$ is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

If we consider the volume needed to fill from the half-full state at the 30th insertion, it is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
In the next insertion (31st insertion), the volume of balls added is $2^{31-1} \times V_{ball} = 2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} \times V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$, the volume added in the 31st insertion is greater than the remaining volume needed to fill the stadium.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

To verify, at 31st insertion, the total volume is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball} - 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{ball} \times [ (2^{31} - 1) - 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) ] = V_{ball} \times [ 2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2 ] = V_{ball}$.
So, at 31st insertion, the stadium is slightly overfilled by $V_{ball}$. However, the question asks how many insertions are *left* to fill it, implying the point at which it becomes full or just full. Since the volume added at each step doubles, it will cross the full mark in just one more step.

Number of insertions left = 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?ANSWER: 1?1?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 cm^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume occupied by the golf balls after 30 insertions is $V/2$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{V}{2}$.
From this equation, we can find the total volume of the stadium $V$:
$V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied by the golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions should be equal to the full volume of the stadium $V$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times v = V$.
Substitute the expression for $V$ we found earlier:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check if $x=1$ is the answer. If $x=1$, then the total number of insertions is $30+1 = 31$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$.
And we found that $V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times v = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$
$V = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$
We see that $V_{31} > V$, meaning that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfull. However, if we consider the number of insertions needed to *fill* it, and at 30th insertion it is half full, then one more insertion should be enough to go from half full to full (or slightly over).
The question asks "how many insertions are left to fill it", which implies finding the smallest integer number of insertions to make it at least full. Since at 30 insertions it is half full, and the number of balls roughly doubles each time, one more insertion should be enough to more than double the filled volume, thus making it full.

The number of additional insertions is $x=1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_n$ be the total volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions.
The number of golf balls inserted in the $i$-th insertion is $2^{i-1}$.
The volume of a golf ball is $40 \text{cm}^3$.
So, the volume added in the $i$-th insertion is $40 \times 2^{i-1} \text{cm}^3$.
The total volume occupied after $n$ insertions is the sum of the volumes added in each insertion from 1 to $n$:
$V_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (40 \times 2^{i-1}) = 40 \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 40 (2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1})$.
This is a geometric series with first term $a = 1$, common ratio $r = 2$, and $n$ terms.
The sum of this geometric series is $\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, $V_n = 40 (2^n - 1) \text{cm}^3$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Then, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = 40 (2^{30} - 1)$.
$\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = 40 (2^{30} - 1)$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times 40 (2^{30} - 1) = 80 (2^{30} - 1)$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. So we are looking for the number of insertions needed to go from the 30th insertion to the point where the stadium is full. This means we are looking for how many more insertions are needed beyond the 30th.
The total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = 40 (2^{30+x} - 1)$.
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$40 (2^{30+x} - 1) = 80 (2^{30} - 1)$.
Divide both sides by 40:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation. Let's check for integer values of $x$.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. And $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$.
So $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$ is approximately $2^{31}$.
If we take $x=1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$, which is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 < 2^{31}$, it means that $30+x$ must be slightly less than $31$.
However, $x$ must be an integer.
Let's check the volumes at insertion 30 and 31.
$V_{30} = 40 (2^{30} - 1) = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{31} = 40 (2^{31} - 1) = 40 (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) = 80 \times 2^{30} - 40$.
$V_{stadium} = 80 (2^{30} - 1) = 80 \times 2^{30} - 80$.
Compare $V_{31}$ and $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{31} = 80 \times 2^{30} - 40$.
$V_{stadium} = 80 \times 2^{30} - 80$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
Since $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$ and $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$, it means that just one more insertion is needed to fill the stadium (and actually overfill it).
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ balls are inserted.
After $n$ insertions, the total number of balls inserted is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x$.
The volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's check for $x=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, $x=1$ is sufficient to fill the stadium.

Let's check for $x=0$:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.
So, $x=0$ is not sufficient.

Therefore, the minimum integer number of additional insertions needed is $x=1$.
The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let V be the volume of the stadium, and v be the volume of a golf ball (v = 40 cm^3).
The number of balls inserted at each insertion follows a geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, 8, ... , 2^(n-1) for the nth insertion.
The total number of balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of this geometric series:
S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = 2^n - 1.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions is V_n = S_n * v = (2^n - 1) * v.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of balls after 30 insertions is V/2.
V/2 = V_30 = (2^30 - 1) * v.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is V = 2 * V/2 = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v = (2 * 2^30 - 2) * v = (2^31 - 2) * v.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let x be the number of insertions left after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Then the total number of insertions will be 30 + x.
The total volume of golf balls after (30 + x) insertions is V_(30+x) = (2^(30+x) - 1) * v.
We want this volume to be equal to the full volume of the stadium V.
V_(30+x) = V
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v = (2^31 - 2) * v
Divide both sides by v:
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2^31 - 2
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 1

Alternatively, we know that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is half full. We need to fill the remaining half. The volume of the remaining half is V/2 = (2^30 - 1) * v.
In the next insertion (the 31st insertion, so x=1), the volume added is 2^(31-1) * v = 2^30 * v.
Since 2^30 * v > (2^30 - 1) * v, the volume added in just one more insertion (the 31st) is already more than the remaining half volume. Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Let's check the volume after 31 insertions:
V_31 = (2^31 - 1) * v.
Is V_31 equal to V
V = (2^31 - 2) * v.
V_31 = (2^31 - 1) * v.
V_31 > V.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly over-filled, but it is filled.
Since we are looking for how many insertions are LEFT to fill it, and one insertion (the 31st) is enough to fill the remaining half (and more), the answer is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume occupied after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions to fill the stadium is $30 + x$.
The volume occupied after $30 + x$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
Substituting the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation or is the closest integer that fills the stadium. We observe that $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$.
If we set $30+x = 31$, then $x = 1$.
For $x = 1$, the volume occupied after $30+1 = 31$ insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We need to check if this volume is equal to or greater than $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Comparing $2^{31} - 1$ and $2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$:
$2^{31} - 1$ vs $2^{31} - 2$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, we have $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled, but it's the first time it is filled or overfilled after being half full at 30 insertions.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_n$ be the volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions.
The number of balls inserted in the $i$-th insertion is $2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
So, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
We want $V_{30+x}$ to be equal to the full stadium volume $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Divide both sides by $40 \text{ cm}^3$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

If we consider that when the stadium is half full at the 30th insertion, then in the next insertion, the volume added is roughly equal to the volume already present, making the stadium full (or slightly more than full).
Let's test $x=1$. Total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
Volume at 31st insertion = $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
We want to check if $V_{31}$ is the full volume.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2 \times (2^{30} - 1)) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Comparing $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$ and $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.

However, the question asks "how many insertions are LEFT to fill it". Since at 31 insertions the stadium is already full (or slightly overfull), and at 30 it is half full, it means only 1 more insertion is needed to go from half full to full.
If we take "fill it" to mean just reaching full capacity, then 1 more insertion is enough to reach and slightly exceed the full capacity. In practical terms, 1 more insertion will fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n$ be the number of insertions to fill the stadium.
Then, $V_n = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$, we get:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked how many insertions are left to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x = n$.
We want to find $x = n - 30$.
Since $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $2^n \approx 2^{31}$, so $n \approx 31$.
Let's check if $n = 31$ insertions is enough to fill the stadium.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that the stadium is filled during the 31st insertion.
Since we are at the 30th insertion and want to know how many more insertions are needed to fill it, we need $31 - 30 = 1$ more insertion.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, the volume occupied after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + k$.
The volume occupied after $30 + k$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
We can divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
Add 1 to both sides:
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find an integer $k$ that satisfies this equation or the closest integer that makes the stadium at least full.
If we consider $30+k = 31$, then $2^{31} = 2^{31}$. This is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
If $30+k = 31$, then $k = 31 - 30 = 1$.
Let's check for $k=1$:
Volume after $30+1=31$ insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, we have $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 1 additional insertion, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
However, before this additional insertion (at 30 insertions), the stadium was half full.
Therefore, 1 additional insertion is sufficient to fill the stadium.

The question asks "how many insertions are left to fill it". This implies we are looking for the number of additional insertions. Since 1 additional insertion is enough to fill (or slightly overfill) the stadium, and 0 is not enough (as it is half full at 30 insertions), the answer must be 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n N_i = \sum_{i=1}^n 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Therefore, $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely, starting from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions required. Then we need to consider a total of $30 + x$ insertions to fill the stadium.
The volume of balls after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 \ge (2^{31} - 2) \times 40$.
Dividing both sides by 40, we get:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x = 1$. Then we consider $30 + 1 = 31$ insertions.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ with $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 \text{ cm}^3$:
$2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$.
So, $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is filled (actually, slightly overfilled).
Since at 30 insertions it was half full, only one more insertion is needed to fill it.

Number of insertions left to fill it = $x = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions.
The volume of a single golf ball is $v = 40 cm^3$.
In the $k$-th insertion, $2^{k-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
So, the volume added in the $k$-th insertion is $2^{k-1} \times v$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is the sum of volumes inserted in each insertion from 1 to $n$:
$V_n = (2^{1-1} + 2^{2-1} + 2^{3-1} + ... + 2^{n-1}) \times v$
$V_n = (2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1}) \times v$
This is a geometric series sum with first term $a = 1$, ratio $r = 2$, and $n$ terms.
The sum of this geometric series is $S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, $V_n = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{V}{2}$
Therefore, the total volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We need to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times v$
We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times v \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's check for $x=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So, $x=1$ is sufficient.
This means that after 1 more insertion (the 31st insertion), the stadium will be at least full.

To check if it is exactly full at some integer insertion number, we set $V_N = V$.
$(2^N - 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$
$2^N - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$
Since $2^N$ must be a power of 2, and $2^{31} - 1$ is not a power of 2 (as it is 1 less than a power of 2 and greater than 1), there is no integer $N$ for which the stadium is exactly full. However, since we are asked "how many insertions are left to fill it", and we found that one more insertion makes it at least full, we should consider the smallest number of insertions to reach at least full capacity.

Since the 31st insertion makes the stadium more than half full and at least full, and at 30th insertion it is exactly half full, it means that only 1 more insertion is needed to fill it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the volume occupied by golf balls after n insertions.
The volume of a single golf ball is $v = 40 cm^3$.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $T_n = \sum_{i=1}^n 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume occupied after $n$ insertions is $V_n = T_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = V/2 = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions, say $x$, needed to fill the stadium completely.
So, we need to find $x$ such that after $30+x$ insertions, the stadium is full, i.e., $V_{30+x} = V$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times v$.
We set $V_{30+x} = V$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation. Let's check for integer values of $x$ starting from $x=1$.
If $x=1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31} = 2^{31} - 1$ is not exactly true, but $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
Let's compare $2^{31}$ and $2^{31} - 1$. Since $2^{31} - 1$ is just slightly less than $2^{31}$, and we are looking for an integer number of insertions, $x=1$ is the most reasonable answer.

Let's check the volume at insertion 31:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$.
We want to compare $V_{31}$ with $V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v + 1 \times v = V + v$.
So, $V_{31} = V + v$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled by the volume of one golf ball. However, since we are asked "how many insertions are left to fill it", and at 30th insertion it is half full, one more insertion should be enough to fill it or slightly overfill it. Given the discrete nature of insertions, and the doubling at each step, it is most likely that 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

If we are looking for the number of insertions to reach AT LEAST full, then 1 insertion is enough.
If we are looking for the number of insertions to be EXACTLY full, then based on $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$, there is no integer solution for $x$. However, in practical terms, and given the wording of the problem, it's likely asking for the number of insertions to reach fullness or slightly exceed it.

In the context of the problem, where balls are inserted and volume doubles with each step, if it is half full at 30th insertion, it will be more than full after 1 more insertion.  Hence, 1 insertion is left to fill it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Final Answer: 1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
Let $N_i$ be the number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion, where $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2-1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This means $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. So, we are looking for the number of insertions needed in total $30+x$ to fill the stadium.
The volume of golf balls after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies this inequality.
Let's test integer values for $x$.
If $x = 1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
If $x = 0$, $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$. Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.

Since $x=1$ is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality, it means that 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill it).
The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted up to the $n$-th insertion is the sum of the geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{1 \cdot (2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted up to the $n$-th insertion is $V_n = N_n \cdot V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
So, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \cdot V_{30} = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
$V_N = (2^N - 1) \cdot V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^N - 1) \cdot V_{ball} = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^N - 1 = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^N - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2$
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find how many more insertions are needed after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then $N = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
This equation does not give an integer solution for $x$.

However, let's consider the volume added in the next insertion after the 30th.
Volume added in the 31st insertion is $2^{31-1} \cdot V_{ball} = 2^{30} \cdot V_{ball}$.
The remaining volume to fill after the 30th insertion is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} \cdot V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$, the volume added in the 31st insertion is greater than the remaining volume to fill.
This implies that just one more insertion (the 31st insertion) is enough to fill the stadium.
Number of insertions left to fill it = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the total volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. So, we are looking for the number of insertions required to reach the stadium volume starting from the state after 30 insertions.
Let $y$ be the total number of insertions to fill the stadium. Then the total volume after $y$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_y = (2^y - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^y - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^y = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^y = 2^{31} - 1$.

Since $2^y = 2^{31} - 1$, we see that $y$ is very close to 31, but not exactly 31 because of the $-1$. However, since the number of balls inserted doubles with each insertion, we can think about how many more insertions are needed from the 30th insertion.
At 30th insertion, the stadium is half full.
In the 31st insertion, we add $N_{31} = 2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$ balls.
The volume added in the 31st insertion is $2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
The remaining volume to fill is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} > 2^{30} - 1$, the volume added in the 31st insertion is greater than the remaining volume needed to fill the stadium.
Therefore, just 1 more insertion is sufficient to fill the stadium (and slightly overfill it).
The number of insertions left to fill it is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = V_{ball} \times S_n = V_{ball} \times (2^n - 1)$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium's volume:
$V_{30} = V_{ball} \times (2^{30} - 1) = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times V_{ball} \times (2^{30} - 1) = V_{ball} \times (2 \times (2^{30} - 1)) = V_{ball} \times (2^{31} - 2)$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions, say $x$, needed to fill the stadium completely. So we are looking for the total number of insertions $30 + x$ such that the volume of golf balls $V_{30+x}$ is equal to $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = V_{ball} \times (2^{30+x} - 1)$.
We set $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$:
$V_{ball} \times (2^{30+x} - 1) = V_{ball} \times (2^{31} - 2)$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
Add 1 to both sides:
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.

To find $x$, we can compare $2^{30+x}$ and $2^{31} - 1$.
If we try $x = 1$, then $30+x = 31$, and $2^{30+x} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$. In fact, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
This means that if we make one more insertion (a total of $30+1=31$ insertions), the volume of golf balls will be $V_{31} = V_{ball} \times (2^{31} - 1)$, which is slightly larger than $V_{stadium} = V_{ball} \times (2^{31} - 2)$.

Since we are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it, and we are working with discrete insertions, the question is likely asking for the minimum integer number of additional insertions required to fill or exceed the stadium's volume.
With 30 insertions, it is half full. With 31 insertions, it is slightly over full.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill it).
Thus, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let V be the volume of the stadium and v be the volume of a single golf ball.
In the n-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of the geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions is $V_n = S_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half the volume of the stadium.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{V}{2}$.
Thus, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let x be the number of additional insertions. Then we are looking at the total number of insertions being $30 + x$.
The volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times v$.
We want to find the smallest integer x such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$. For exactly full, we would set $V_{30+x} = V$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times v = V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Divide both sides by v:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

If we try x=1, total insertions = 31.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v$.
Is $V_{31} = V$
$V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v = (2^{31} - 2) \times v$.
$V_{31} - V = (2^{31} - 1) \times v - (2^{31} - 2) \times v = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) \times v = 1 \times v = v$.
So, $V_{31} = V + v$. The volume after 31 insertions is slightly more than the full volume V.
This means that with 1 additional insertion, the stadium is filled (and slightly overfilled). Since at 30 insertions it is half full, we need to find how many *more* insertions are needed to fill it. Since 1 more insertion makes it overfull, and 0 is not enough to reach full (from half-full to full requires doubling volume approximately and one insertion roughly doubles the volume already in). Thus, 1 more insertion is needed.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Rationale:
Let $V$ be the volume of the stadium and $v = 40 \text{ cm}^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After 30 insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $S_{30} = \sum_{i=1}^{30} 2^{i-1} = \sum_{j=0}^{29} 2^j = 2^{30} - 1$.
The volume occupied by golf balls after 30 insertions is $V_{30} = S_{30} \times v = (2^{30} - 1) v$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$.
Therefore, $\frac{1}{2} V = (2^{30} - 1) v$, which means $V = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) v = (2^{31} - 2) v$.

Let $k$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
After $k$ insertions, the volume occupied by golf balls is $V_k = (2^k - 1) v$.
To fill the stadium, we need $V_k \ge V$. We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $V_k \ge V$.
$(2^k - 1) v \ge (2^{31} - 2) v$.
$2^k - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^k \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
We need to find the smallest integer $k$ satisfying this inequality.
If we take $k = 31$, then $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$, which is true.
If we take $k = 30$, then $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$, which is false because $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.
Thus, the smallest integer $k$ is 31.
So, we need 31 insertions to fill the stadium.
We have already performed 30 insertions.
The number of insertions left to fill the stadium is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_b$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_s$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_b = (2^n - 1) V_b$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_b = \frac{1}{2} V_s$.
This implies that the full volume of the stadium is $V_s = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the total number of insertions required to fill the stadium.
Then, $V_N = (2^N - 1) V_b = V_s$.
Substituting the value of $V_s$, we get:
$(2^N - 1) V_b = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.
Dividing both sides by $V_b$:
$2^N - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. So, $N = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
If we approximate $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$, then $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$, which means $30+x \approx 31$, so $x \approx 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$. Total insertions = $30 + 1 = 31$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_b$.
Stadium volume is $V_s = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.
We can compare $V_{31}$ and $V_s$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_b = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) V_b$.
$V_s = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_b$.
$V_{31} - V_s = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) V_b - (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_b = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1 - 2 \times 2^{30} + 2) V_b = 1 \times V_b = V_b$.
So, $V_{31} = V_s + V_b$.
The volume after 31 insertions is slightly more than the stadium volume by the volume of one golf ball.
Since we are asked "how many insertions are left to fill it", and given the doubling nature, it is most likely asking for the integer number of insertions that will fill or slightly overfill the stadium. In this context, 1 more insertion is needed.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is given as $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
The number of golf balls inserted in each insertion doubles with each insertion:
Insertion 1: $2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1$ ball
Insertion 2: $2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2$ balls
Insertion 3: $2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4$ balls
...
Insertion n: $2^{n-1}$ balls

The total number of balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.

The total volume of golf balls inserted after n insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
Therefore, the full stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions required after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume of golf balls after $30+x$ insertions should be equal to the full stadium volume:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$

Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$

Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find an integer value for $x$. Let's test if $x=1$:
If $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$2^{31} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$
This equality holds true.
Therefore, $x=1$.

So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium completely.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $T_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $k$ insertions is $V_k = T_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $m$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + m$. We want to find the smallest integer $m \ge 0$ such that the volume after $30 + m$ insertions is at least $V_{stadium}$.
The volume after $30 + m$ insertions is $V_{30+m} = (2^{30+m} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $m$ such that $V_{30+m} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+m} - 1) V_{ball} \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+m} - 1 \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+m} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+m} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+m} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+m} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $m=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So $m=1$ is enough. This means we need only 1 more insertion after the 30th insertion.

Let's check if $m=0$ is enough.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0$, and $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.
So $m=0$ is not enough.

Therefore, the smallest integer $m$ is 1. This means we need 1 more insertion to fill the stadium.

Number of insertions left to fill it is $m=1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
The number of balls inserted in the $n$-th insertion is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{1 \cdot (2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \cdot V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \cdot V_{30} = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot V_{ball} = (2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2) \cdot V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \cdot V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $N$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then, the volume of balls after $N$ insertions must be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_N = (2^N - 1) \cdot V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \cdot V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$.

We know that $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$. If we approximate $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$, then $2^N \approx 2^{31}$, which gives $N \approx 31$.
Let's check for $N = 31$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \cdot V_{ball}$.
We compare $V_{31}$ with $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \cdot V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} - V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 1) \cdot V_{ball} - (2^{31} - 2) \cdot V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 1 - 2^{31} + 2) \cdot V_{ball} = 1 \cdot V_{ball} = V_{ball}$.
So, $V_{31} = V_{stadium} + V_{ball}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled by the volume of one golf ball. However, since we are asked how many insertions are *left* to fill it, and at 30th insertion it is half full, and at 31st insertion it is slightly over full, it means just 1 more insertion is needed to go from half full to (slightly over) full.
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times 40 cm^3$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times 40 = (2^{31} - 2) \times 40 cm^3$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. So, we are looking for the number of insertions needed such that the total number of insertions is $30 + x$ and the stadium is full.
The volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 cm^3$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 \ge (2^{31} - 2) \times 40$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's test some values for $x$.
If $x = 1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. And $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This condition is satisfied.
If $x = 0$, $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$. And $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$. This condition is not satisfied.

Therefore, the smallest integer value for $x$ that satisfies the condition is $x = 1$.
So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then we are looking for the total number of insertions $30 + x$ such that the stadium is filled.
The volume after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We need to find the smallest integer $x \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's test values for $x$.
If $x = 0$, $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$. Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0 > 2^{30}$ is false and $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.
If $x = 1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, because $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.

So, the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies the condition is $x = 1$.
This means that 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?
