$V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times v = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{1}{2} V$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $n$ be the number of insertions to fill the stadium completely.
Then $V_n = V$.
$(2^n - 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^n - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^n - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$

We are asked for the number of insertions left to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $m$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + m = n$.
$2^{30+m} = 2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $2^{30+m} \approx 2^{31}$.
$30+m \approx 31$
$m \approx 31 - 30$
$m \approx 1$

Let's check if 1 additional insertion is enough.
After 30 insertions, volume is $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$.
In the 31st insertion, we add $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$ balls.
The volume added in the 31st insertion is $2^{30} \times v$.
The volume already in the stadium is $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Since $2^{30} > 2^{30} - 1$, the volume added in the 31st insertion is greater than the volume already present in the stadium at the 30th insertion relative to the amount needed to fill the stadium to its full capacity from the half-full state. In fact, it is approximately equal to the volume already present at the 30th insertion.
Therefore, one more insertion is sufficient to fill the stadium.

Let's verify more precisely. At 30th insertion, half full. Need to fill another half.
Volume to fill = $V/2 = (2^{30} - 1) v$.
Volume added in 31st insertion = $2^{30} v$.
Since $2^{30} v > (2^{30} - 1) v$, one more insertion is enough to fill the remaining volume.
Thus, only 1 more insertion is needed.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let V be the volume of the stadium.
Let $V_b$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_b = 40 cm^3$.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_b = (2^n - 1) V_b$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_b = \frac{V}{2}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $m$ be the number of insertions to fill the stadium.
We need to find $m$ such that $V_m = V$.
$V_m = (2^m - 1) V_b = V = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.
Divide both sides by $V_b$:
$2^m - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^m - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^m = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion.
At the 30th insertion, the stadium is half full. We need to fill the remaining half.
The volume remaining to be filled is $\frac{V}{2} = (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.
In the next insertion, the 31st insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$.
The volume added in the 31st insertion is $2^{30} V_b$.
Since $2^{30} V_b > (2^{30} - 1) V_b$, one more insertion (the 31st insertion) will be enough to fill the remaining volume and even slightly overfill the stadium.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the n-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium's volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
From this, we can find the full volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of insertions, say $N$, required to fill the stadium completely. The volume of golf balls after $N$ insertions must be equal to the stadium's volume:
$V_N = (2^N - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^N - 1) V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^N - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^N - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$

We are looking for the number of insertions left to fill the stadium, which is $N - 30$.
Since $2^N = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $2^N$ is very close to $2^{31}$.
If $2^N = 2^{31}$, then $N = 31$.
Let's check if $N=31$ is the answer.
If $N=31$, the volume filled is $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
The stadium volume is $2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Comparing $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$ and $(2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$, we see that $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} > (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
So, at 31st insertion, the stadium is slightly overfilled, but it is the first insertion after 30th to fill (or overfill) the stadium.
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill it is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, and let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion. We are given that $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.

The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium. Then, at the 30th insertion, the volume of golf balls is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
So, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then we want to find $n$ such that $V_n \ge V_{stadium}$. We want to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $V_n \ge V_{stadium}$.
$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} \ge V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^n - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^n \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^n \ge 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality.
If $n = 31$, then $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$, which is true.
If $n = 30$, then $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$, since $2^{31} - 1 - 2^{30} = 2^{30} - 1 > 0$.
So, the smallest integer $n$ is 31.

The number of insertions already made is 30. The number of insertions left to fill it is the total number of insertions needed minus the insertions already made, which is $n - 30 = 31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let v = 40 cm^3 be the volume of a single golf ball.
In the nth insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after n insertions is given by:
$V_n = v \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = v (1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1})$
This is a geometric series sum: $V_n = v \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = v (2^n - 1)$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = V/2 = v (2^{30} - 1)$
So, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 V_{30} = 2 v (2^{30} - 1) = v (2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2) = v (2^{31} - 2)$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let x be the number of additional insertions. So we are looking at total $30 + x$ insertions.
The total volume after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = v (2^{30+x} - 1)$.
We want to find the smallest integer x such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$v (2^{30+x} - 1) \ge v (2^{31} - 2)$
Divide both sides by v (since v > 0):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's test x = 1:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So, x = 1 is sufficient.

Let's check x = 0:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0$ and $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.

Therefore, the smallest integer x that satisfies the condition is x = 1.
So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the full volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $k$ be the total number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then, the volume of golf balls after $k$ insertions should be equal to the volume of the stadium:
$V_k = (2^k - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^k - 1) V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^k - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^k - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^k - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^k = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^k = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find how many insertions are left after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x = k$.
We need to find $x = k - 30$.
Since $2^k = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $k$ is very close to 31. In fact, if $2^k = 2^{31}$, then $k = 31$.
Let's check if $k=31$ is the answer or very close to the answer.
If $k=31$, then $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V_{stadium}$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$ and $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, we have $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
However, the question asks "how many insertions are LEFT to fill it". Since at 30th insertion it is half full, and in each insertion the number of balls doubles, one more insertion should be enough to more than double the volume and fill the stadium.
From 30th to 31st insertion, we just need 1 more insertion.

Let's verify this step-by-step.
At insertion 30, stadium is half full.
Volume to fill = Half of stadium volume = $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Volume added in the 31st insertion = $2^{31-1} V_{ball} = 2^{30} V_{ball}$.
Is the volume added in the 31st insertion enough to fill the remaining half
Volume added in 31st insertion = $2^{30} V_{ball}$.
Remaining volume to fill = $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$, the volume added in the 31st insertion is more than the remaining volume to fill.
Therefore, just 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Number of insertions left = $k - 30$.
Since $k$ is very close to 31 and we checked that 31 insertions is enough to fill the stadium, we can assume $k=31$ or the closest integer.
From $2^k = 2^{31} - 1$, we can see that $k$ must be slightly less than 31, but since insertions are in integer steps, the first integer insertion that fills the stadium after 30 is the 31st insertion.
So, number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let V be the total volume of the stadium and v be the volume of a golf ball (v = 40 cm^3).
In the n-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is 2^(n-1).
The total number of golf balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of the geometric series:
Total balls(n) = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = 2^n - 1.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions is:
Total Volume(n) = (2^n - 1) * v.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, Total Volume(30) = V/2.
V/2 = (2^30 - 1) * v.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is V = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely after the 30th insertion. Let x be the number of additional insertions needed. This means we are looking at the total number of insertions as 30 + x.
The total volume after (30 + x) insertions is Total Volume(30 + x) = (2^(30+x) - 1) * v.
We want this volume to be equal to the full volume of the stadium V.
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v = V = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v.
Divide both sides by v:
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * (2^30 - 1)
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * 2^30 - 2
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 1

We are looking for an integer value of x. Let's consider x = 1.
If x = 1, then we consider the volume after 30 + 1 = 31 insertions.
Total Volume(31) = (2^31 - 1) * v.
Is this volume equal to V
V = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v = (2 * 2^30 - 2) * v = (2^31 - 2) * v.
Comparing Total Volume(31) and V:
Total Volume(31) = (2^31 - 1) * v
V = (2^31 - 2) * v
Since (2^31 - 1) * v > (2^31 - 2) * v, Total Volume(31) > V.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is filled (and even slightly overfilled).
Since at 30 insertions the stadium is half full, and at 31 insertions it is full (or more), it means that exactly one more insertion is needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.

Number of insertions left = 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of the geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{1 \cdot (2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \cdot V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n_{full}$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then the volume of balls after $n_{full}$ insertions should be equal to the stadium volume:
$V_{n_{full}} = (2^{n_{full}} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
Add 1 to both sides:
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find the number of insertions left after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then $n_{full} = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
If we consider $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$, and $2^{31} = 2^{31}$.
Since $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$, and we are dealing with discrete insertions, let's consider the volume after $30+1=31$ insertions:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
And the full volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled. However, we are looking for the number of insertions needed to fill it. Since at 30 insertions it is half full, and at 31 insertions it is more than full, it means that exactly 1 more insertion is needed to go from half full to full (or more than full).
Therefore, only 1 insertion is left to fill it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1)v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2}V$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{1}{2}V$
So, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2V_{30} = 2(2^{30} - 1)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then $V_N = V$.
$V_N = (2^N - 1)v = V = (2^{31} - 2)v$
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^N - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^N = 2^{31} - 1$

We are asked how many insertions are left to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then $N = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$
We need to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation or makes the stadium full or slightly overfull.
If we consider $x=1$, then $N = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$.
We want to check if $V_{31} \ge V$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$
$V = (2^{31} - 2)v$
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, we have $V_{31} > V$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
However, we are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it. Since at 30th insertion it is half full, and at 31st insertion it is over full, it means just 1 more insertion is needed to go from half full to full (or over full).
Therefore, there is 1 insertion left to fill it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
At each insertion $i$, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $T_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = T_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume of balls after 30 insertions is half the volume of the stadium.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
So, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is equal to or greater than the stadium volume.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's test $x = 1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, with 1 additional insertion, the stadium will be filled (or more than filled).

Let's test $x = 0$.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.
So, 0 additional insertions is not enough.

Therefore, the number of additional insertions needed is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion, where $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find $x$ such that $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We set $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find integer $x$. Let's check if $x=1$.
If $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$2^{31} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
This equality holds. So, $x=1$ is the solution.
The number of additional insertions needed is 1.

Therefore, there is only 1 insertion left to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion. We are given that $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{1 \cdot (2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.

Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{ cm}^3$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \cdot V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \cdot 40 \text{ cm}^3$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \cdot 40 = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot 40$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n_{full}$ be the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
$V_{n_{full}} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{n_{full}} - 1) \cdot 40 = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot 40$
Divide both sides by 40:
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2 \cdot 1$
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then $n_{full} = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

If we approximate $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$, then $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$, which gives $30+x = 31$, so $x = 1$.

Let's check if for $x=1$, the stadium is full.
Number of insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
Volume after 31 insertions $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \cdot 40$.
Stadium volume $V_{stadium} = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot 40$.
We need to check if $V_{31} = V_{stadium}$.
Is $(2^{31} - 1) \cdot 40 = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot 40$
Is $2^{31} - 1 = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1)$
Is $2^{31} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
No, $2^{31} - 1 \neq 2^{31} - 2$.

However, if we consider that at the 30th insertion the stadium is *exactly* half full, and we are looking for an integer answer, the approximation that doubling the insertions from 30 to 31 will approximately double the volume and fill the stadium makes sense in the context of these exponential series.
Based on the approximation, the number of insertions left is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?ANSWER: 1?1?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let v = 40 cm^3 be the volume of a golf ball.
In the n-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is 2^(n-1).
The total number of golf balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = _{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = (2^n - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^n - 1.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions is V_n = N_n * v = (2^n - 1) * v.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
V_30 = V/2
(2^30 - 1) * v = V/2
Thus, the full volume of the stadium is V = 2 * V_30 = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let x be the number of additional insertions. So we are looking at the (30+x)-th insertion in total.
The volume of golf balls after (30+x) insertions is V_(30+x) = (2^(30+x) - 1) * v.
We want to find the smallest integer x such that V_(30+x) >= V.
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v >= V
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v >= 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v
Divide both sides by v (since v > 0):
2^(30+x) - 1 >= 2 * (2^30 - 1)
2^(30+x) - 1 >= 2 * 2^30 - 2
2^(30+x) >= 2 * 2^30 - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) >= 2 * 2^30 - 1
2^(30+x) >= 2^(31) - 1

Let's test x = 1.
2^(30+1) = 2^31.
Is 2^31 >= 2^31 - 1 Yes, it is.
So, x = 1 is sufficient.

Let's test x = 0.
2^(30+0) = 2^30.
Is 2^30 >= 2^31 - 1 No, because 2^31 - 1 > 2^31 / 2 = 2^30.
So, x = 0 is not sufficient.

Therefore, the minimum number of additional insertions needed is 1.

Number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $N_i = 2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
This means that the total volume of golf balls inserted after 30 insertions is half the volume of the stadium.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
So, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely.
Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion.
Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We need to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the total volume after $30 + x$ insertions is at least $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$
We want $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies this inequality.
Let's test $x = 1$.
If $x = 1$, then $30 + x = 31$.
$2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$
This is true.
So, 1 additional insertion is enough to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill it).
If $x = 0$, then $30 + x = 30$.
$2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$
$2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$
This is false.

Thus, the smallest integer $x$ is 1.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the total volume of golf balls inserted after n insertions.
The number of golf balls inserted in the $k$-th insertion is $2^{k-1}$.
The volume of a golf ball is $v = 40 cm^3$.
So, the volume inserted in the $k$-th insertion is $2^{k-1} \times v$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is the sum of the volumes inserted in each insertion from 1 to $n$:
$V_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} \times v = v \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} = v \times (1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1})$.
This is a geometric series with first term $a = 1$, common ratio $r = 2$, and $n$ terms.
The sum of this geometric series is $\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, $V_n = (2^n - 1) \times v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{V}{2}$.
We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions.
The total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times v$.
We want $V_{30+x} = V$.
We know $V/2 = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$, so $V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
We need to find $x$ such that $(2^{30+x} - 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$.
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

Since $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$.
This means $30+x \approx 31$, so $x \approx 1$.
Let's check if $x=1$ is enough.
If $x=1$, total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 1) \times v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1) \times v = (2 \times (2^{30} - 1) + 1) \times v = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v + 1 \times v = V + v$.
Since $V_{31} = V + v > V$, it means that after 1 more insertion, the stadium will be overfilled.
Therefore, exactly 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of the volumes of golf balls inserted in each insertion from 1 to $n$:
$$V_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2^{i-1} \times v) = v \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = v \times (1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1})$$
The sum of the geometric series $1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1}$ is $\frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
So, the total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1)v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is $V/2$.
$$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{V}{2}$$
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium $V$:
$$V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$$

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x$. We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the volume after $30+x$ insertions is at least $V$.
The volume after $30+x$ insertions is:
$$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1)v$$
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$$(2^{30+x} - 1)v \ge (2^{31} - 2)v$$
Divide both sides by $v$ (since $v > 0$):
$$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$$
$$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$$
$$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$$
Divide both sides by $2^{30}$:
$$2^x \ge \frac{2^{31} - 1}{2^{30}} = \frac{2^{31}}{2^{30}} - \frac{1}{2^{30}} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{30}}$$
Since $\frac{1}{2^{30}}$ is a very small positive number, $2 - \frac{1}{2^{30}}$ is slightly less than 2.
We need to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $2^x \ge 2 - \frac{1}{2^{30}}$.
If $x = 1$, $2^1 = 2$. Since $2 > 2 - \frac{1}{2^{30}}$, $x=1$ is sufficient.
If $x = 0$, $2^0 = 1$. Since $1 < 2 - \frac{1}{2^{30}}$, $x=0$ is not sufficient.
Therefore, the smallest integer $x$ is $1$.

So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v$ be the volume of a golf ball, $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After $n$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^{j} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times v = (2^n - 1)v$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{1}{2}V$.
So the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2V_{30} = 2(2^{30} - 1)v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. The volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1)v$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1)v \ge (2^{31} - 2)v$
Divide both sides by $v$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's test $x = 1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So $x = 1$ is sufficient.

Let's test $x = 0$:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0$ and $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.
So $x = 0$ is not sufficient.

Therefore, the minimum number of additional insertions needed is $x = 1$.
The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let v be the volume of a single golf ball, v = 40 cm^3.
In the n-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after n insertions is given by the sum of the volumes of balls inserted in each insertion from 1 to n.
The volume of balls inserted in the n-th insertion is $2^{n-1} \times v$.
The cumulative volume of balls after n insertions is $V_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} \times v = v \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = v \times (1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1})$.
This is a geometric series sum, which is equal to $v \times \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = v \times (2^n - 1)$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of balls at the 30th insertion is $V_{30} = \frac{V}{2}$.
$V_{30} = v \times (2^{30} - 1) = \frac{V}{2}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times v \times (2^{30} - 1) = v \times (2 \times (2^{30} - 1)) = v \times (2^{31} - 2)$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions required to fill the stadium completely. Let x be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. So we are looking at the total number of insertions as $30 + x$.
The volume of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = v \times (2^{30+x} - 1)$.
We want to find the smallest integer x such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$v \times (2^{30+x} - 1) \ge v \times (2^{31} - 2)$
Divide both sides by v:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's check for x = 1.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is true.
So, with 1 additional insertion, the stadium will be filled (or even overfilled).
Let's check for x = 0.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
$2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is false.
So, we need at least 1 additional insertion.

Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
The number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion is $2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied after $30 + x$ insertions must be equal to the full volume of the stadium:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation or is the closest integer that fills the stadium.
Let's test $x=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, if $x=1$, $2^{30+1} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$, which is indeed greater than $2^{31} - 2 = 2(2^{30} - 1)$.
This means that with 1 more insertion, the stadium will be slightly overfilled. Since we are asked for the number of insertions *left to fill it*, and we cannot have fractional insertions, 1 insertion is the smallest integer number of insertions that will fill (or slightly overfill) the stadium after it was half full at the 30th insertion.

Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill the stadium is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
At the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions, let's say $x$, needed to fill the stadium completely.
The total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The total volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions should be equal to the volume of the stadium:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
Add 1 to both sides:
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.
Let's test integer values for $x$.
If $x = 1$, $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$. Since $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$, $x = 1$ insertions will slightly overfill the stadium (or exactly fill it, considering the discrete nature of insertions).
If $x = 0$, $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
$2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$. So $x = 0$ is not enough to fill the stadium.
Since we are looking for the number of insertions left to fill it, and 1 insertion is enough to make the volume at least the stadium volume, the answer must be 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After $n$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times 40 \text{cm}^3$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40 \text{cm}^3$.

Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely after the 30th insertion. So, we are looking for the number of insertions $30+x$ such that the stadium is full.
$V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times 40 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40$
Divide both sides by 40:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation. Let's check if $x=1$:
If $x=1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
We need to check if $2^{31} = 2^{31} - 1$. This is not exactly true, but $2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
In fact, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$. This means that with 1 additional insertion, the stadium becomes slightly overfull compared to the calculated full volume $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times 40$.
However, given the context and the nature of the problem (doubling), it is highly likely that the question is designed such that after exactly one more insertion, the stadium becomes full.

Let's consider the ratio of volumes from insertion 30 to 31.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times 40$
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times 40$
$\frac{V_{31}}{V_{30}} = \frac{2^{31} - 1}{2^{30} - 1} = \frac{2 \times 2^{30} - 1}{2^{30} - 1} = \frac{2 \times (2^{30} - 1) + 2 - 1}{2^{30} - 1} = 2 + \frac{1}{2^{30} - 1}$
This ratio is slightly greater than 2. So, the volume more than doubles from insertion 30 to 31.
If at insertion 30 it is half full, then at insertion 31 it will be slightly more than full.
Since we are asked for the number of insertions to *fill* it, and given the near doubling, 1 additional insertion should be sufficient to reach or exceed the full volume. Given the options are integers, and 1 is the most logical answer based on the doubling nature, we choose 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is approximately 40 cm$^3$.
Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion, where $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume filled after $n$ insertions is $V_{filled}(n) = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{filled}(30) = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the total volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{filled}(30) = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume filled after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{filled}(30+x) = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
To fill the stadium, we need $V_{filled}(30+x) \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies this inequality.
Let's test $x=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is true.
So, $x=1$ is a valid solution.

Let's test $x=0$.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0$, and $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.

Therefore, the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $x=1$.
So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of golf balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Thus, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the volume after $30+x$ insertions is at least $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} \ge (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, with $x=1$ additional insertion, the stadium will be filled (and actually slightly overfilled).
This means that after $30+1 = 31$ insertions, the stadium is full.
Since at the 30th insertion the stadium is half full, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill it.

Number of insertions left to fill it = $x = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_b$ be the volume of a golf ball, and $V_s$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_k = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_b = (2^k - 1) V_b$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume filled after 30 insertions is $\frac{1}{2} V_s$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_b = \frac{1}{2} V_s$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_s = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let's say $x$ more insertions are needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x$.
The volume filled after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_b$.
To fill the stadium, we need $V_{30+x} = V_s$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_b = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b$.
Divide both sides by $V_b$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find an integer $x$. Let's check for $x=1$.
If $x=1$, then total insertions = $30+1=31$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_b$.
Is $V_{31} = V_s$
$V_s = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_b = (2^{31} - 2) V_b$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_b$.
$V_{31} > V_s$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled. However, since at 30 insertions it is half full, adding one more insertion will surely fill it.
Since we are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it, and after 1 more insertion (from 30th to 31st) the stadium becomes full (or slightly overfull), then the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the total volume of golf balls after n insertions.
The number of balls inserted in the k-th insertion is $2^{k-1}$.
The volume of each golf ball is $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
The volume added in the k-th insertion is $2^{k-1} \times v$.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions is the sum of the volumes added in each insertion from 1 to n:
$V_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2^{k-1} \times v) = v \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} = v (1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1})$.
This is a geometric series sum: $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} r^i = \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}$. Here $r = 2$.
So, $\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
Therefore, $V_n = (2^n - 1) v$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) v = \frac{V}{2}$.
So, the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) v = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) v = (2^{31} - 2) v$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V$.
$V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) v$.
We want to find the smallest $k$ such that $(2^{30+k} - 1) v \ge V = (2^{31} - 2) v$.
Divide both sides by $v$ (since $v > 0$):
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $k=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, with $k=1$ additional insertion, the stadium will be filled (or overfilled).
This means that after 1 more insertion from the 30th insertion, the stadium will be filled.
The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
The number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This implies $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions required to fill the stadium. So we are looking at the $(30+x)$-th insertion in total to fill the stadium.
The volume of balls after $(30+x)$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
For the stadium to be full, we need $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

Let's consider the volume added at each step.
At 30th insertion, volume is half full. We need to fill another half.
The number of balls added at the 31st insertion is $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$.
The volume added at the 31st insertion is $2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
The remaining volume to fill is $0.5 V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} \times V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$, the volume added at the 31st insertion is greater than the remaining volume needed to fill the stadium.
Therefore, just 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium (and it will slightly overfill it, but we assume "fill it" means reaching the full capacity).
So, $x = 1$.

Number of insertions left is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium and $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
The number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion is $2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $n$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then, the volume of balls inserted should be equal to the volume of the stadium:
$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$, we get:
$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of insertions left. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
If we consider integer solutions for $x$, we can test integer values.
If $x = 1$, then $30 + x = 31$, and $2^{31} = 2^{31}$. This is very close to $2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{31}$ is much larger than 1, $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$.
So, $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$, which means $30+x \approx 31$, so $x \approx 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$. After $30+1 = 31$ insertions, the volume is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
The stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$ because $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} > (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is filled (slightly overfilled).
Since at 30 insertions it is half full, and at 31 insertions it is full, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $n$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + n$. We want to find the smallest integer $n$ such that the volume of balls after $30+n$ insertions is at least the volume of the stadium.
$V_{30+n} = (2^{30+n} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $V_{30+n} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+n} - 1) V_{ball} \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+n} - 1 \ge 2 (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+n} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+n} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+n} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$.
$2^{30+n} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $n=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, for $n=1$, the stadium is filled (or overfilled).
Let's check for $n=0$:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.
So, for $n=0$, the stadium is not filled.

Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ is 1.
Thus, 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion, where $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions, $V_{30}$, is half the volume of the stadium, $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n_{full}$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium.
$V_{n_{full}} = (2^{n_{full}} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{n_{full}} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{n_{full}} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find how many more insertions are left to fill it after the 30th insertion.
Number of insertions left = $n_{full} - 30$.
Since $2^{n_{full}} = 2^{31} - 1$, and $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $n_{full} \approx 31$.
Let's check if $n_{full} = 31$.
If $n_{full} = 31$, then $2^{31} - 1$.
Stadium volume is $2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $(2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $(2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball} > (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$, 31 insertions are enough to fill the stadium.
Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, where $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $S_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $k$ insertions is $V_k = S_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means:
$V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $m$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + m$. We want to find the smallest integer $m$ such that the volume occupied after $30 + m$ insertions is equal to or greater than $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+m} = (2^{30+m} - 1) V_{ball}$
We need to find $m$ such that $V_{30+m} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+m} - 1) V_{ball} \ge (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+m} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+m} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+m} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's test values for $m$:
If $m = 1$, then $30+m = 31$, and $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is true.
If $m = 0$, then $30+m = 30$, and $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is false, because $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.

Therefore, the smallest integer $m$ that satisfies the inequality is $m = 1$.
So, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Rationale:
Let $V$ be the volume of the stadium, and $v = 40 cm^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After 30 insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{29} = \sum_{i=0}^{29} 2^i = 2^{30} - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2}V$.
Thus, $\frac{1}{2}V = (2^{30} - 1)v$, which means $V = 2(2^{30} - 1)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$.
We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
The total volume of golf balls after $N$ insertions is $V_N = (2^N - 1)v$.
We want to find the smallest integer $N$ such that $V_N \ge V$.
We want to find $N$ such that $(2^N - 1)v \ge (2^{31} - 2)v$.
$2^N - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^N \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
We want to find the smallest integer $N$ satisfying this inequality.
If $N = 31$, then $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$, which is true.
If $N = 30$, then $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$, since $2^{31} - 1 - 2^{30} = 2^{30} - 1 > 0$.
So, the smallest integer $N$ is $31$.
Thus, it takes 31 insertions to fill the stadium.
We are asked how many insertions are left to fill it after the 30th insertion.
Since it takes 31 insertions to fill the stadium, and we have already performed 30 insertions, the number of insertions left is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_b$ be the volume of a golf ball.
The number of balls inserted at each insertion follows a geometric progression: $1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{n-1}$ for the $n$-th insertion.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of this geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \ldots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_b = (2^n - 1) V_b$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_b = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_b = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_b = (2^{31} - 2) V_b$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. So we are looking at the $(30+x)$-th insertion.
The total volume occupied after $(30+x)$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_b$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_b \ge (2^{31} - 2) V_b$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

If we consider $x = 1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_b$
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V_{stadium}$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_b$
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_b$
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, we have $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 1 more insertion (at the 31st insertion in total), the stadium is filled (actually slightly overfilled).

Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill the stadium is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?The number of balls inserted at each insertion follows a geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, ... , 2^(n-1) for the n-th insertion.
The total number of balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of this geometric series:
S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = 2^n - 1.

Let V_ball be the volume of a single golf ball.
The total volume of golf balls after n insertions is V_n = S_n * V_ball = (2^n - 1) * V_ball.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let V_stadium be the total volume of the stadium.
V_30 = (2^30 - 1) * V_ball = 0.5 * V_stadium.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
V_stadium = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * V_ball.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely. Let x be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. So, we are looking at the (30+x)-th insertion in total.
The total volume of golf balls after (30+x) insertions is:
V_(30+x) = (2^(30+x) - 1) * V_ball.
For the stadium to be full, V_(30+x) must be equal to V_stadium:
(2^(30+x) - 1) * V_ball = V_stadium
(2^(30+x) - 1) * V_ball = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * V_ball.
Divide both sides by V_ball:
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * (2^30 - 1)
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * 2^30 - 2
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2^(31) - 2
2^(30+x) = 2^(31) - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) = 2^(31) - 1

We are looking for an integer value for x. Let's consider the implications if we take x = 1.
Total insertions = 30 + 1 = 31.
Volume after 31 insertions = (2^31 - 1) * V_ball.
Stadium Volume = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * V_ball = (2 * 2^30 - 2) * V_ball = (2^(31) - 2) * V_ball.
Comparing (2^31 - 1) * V_ball and (2^(31) - 2) * V_ball, we see that (2^31 - 1) * V_ball is slightly larger than (2^(31) - 2) * V_ball.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium will be slightly overfull, but it's the closest integer number of insertions to fill it.
However, if we consider the question "how may insertions are left to fill it", and given the doubling nature, it is highly likely that exactly one more insertion is needed to go from half-full to full (or slightly overfull, which in a practical sense, we can consider full).

If we consider the number of balls, at 30 insertions, we have 2^30 - 1 balls, which is half the capacity. The full capacity is then 2 * (2^30 - 1).
To reach this capacity, we need to find n such that 2^n - 1 = 2 * (2^30 - 1). We've already shown that n is not an integer in this exact equation.
But if we consider approximation and practical sense of "fill it", 1 more insertion seems to be the most reasonable answer.

Considering the nature of the problem and likely intended integer answer, let's assume that after 31 insertions the stadium is considered filled. The number of additional insertions after 30 is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means the volume occupied by golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
So, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $30+x$ insertions should be equal to the full volume of the stadium.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.
Let's check for integer values of $x$ starting from $x=1$.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31} = 2^{31} - 1$ No. $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
This means that $2^{31} - 1$ is slightly less than $2^{31}$.
So, $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$ means $30+x$ is slightly less than $31$.
However, we are inserting discrete numbers of balls.
Let's check the volume filled after 31 insertions:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$
Is $V_{31} \ge V_{stadium}$
Is $(2^{31} - 1) V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Is $2^{31} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
Is $2^{31} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$ Yes, because $-1 > -2$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is filled (and slightly overfilled, if we consider exact volume).
Since after 30 insertions it is half full, we need just 1 more insertion to fill it.
The number of insertions left to fill it is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.

After 30 insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_{30} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{30-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{29} 2^i = \frac{2^{30} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{30} - 1$

The total volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is:
$V_{30} = N_{30} \times v = (2^{30} - 1) \times v$

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V$
$(2^{30} - 1) \times v = \frac{1}{2} V$
$V = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions. Then we are looking at a total of $30 + k$ insertions.
The total number of golf balls after $30 + k$ insertions is:
$N_{30+k} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{(30+k)-1} = 2^{30+k} - 1$

The total volume of golf balls after $30 + k$ insertions is:
$V_{30+k} = N_{30+k} \times v = (2^{30+k} - 1) \times v$

We want to find the smallest integer $k \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V$.
$(2^{30+k} - 1) \times v \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times v$
Divide both sides by $v$ (since $v > 0$):
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+k} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+k} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's test for $k=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.

Let's test for $k=0$:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{30} = 2^{30}$.

Therefore, the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k=1$.
So, there is only 1 insertion left to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Rationale:
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium, and $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball. We are given $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After 30 insertions, the total number of balls inserted is $N_{30} = \sum_{i=1}^{30} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{29} = \frac{2^{30} - 1}{2-1} = 2^{30} - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is $V_{30} = N_{30} \times V_{ball} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then, the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The total number of balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $N_{30+x} = \sum_{i=1}^{30+x} 2^{i-1} = 2^{30+x} - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = N_{30+x} \times V_{ball} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
To fill the stadium, we need $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are looking for an integer value of $x$. Let's test integer values starting from $x=1$.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
$2^{31}$ is very close to $2^{31} - 1$. In fact, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, if we take $x = 1$, the volume of balls will be slightly more than the stadium volume we calculated (if we were to solve $2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$ exactly, x would be slightly less than 1, but it needs to be an integer number of insertions).
Since we are asked for the number of insertions left to fill it, and with each insertion the number of balls doubles, it is most likely that exactly one more insertion is needed to fill or slightly overfill the stadium.

If we insert for 1 more time (i.e., $x=1$), we will perform a total of 31 insertions.
The total volume will be $(2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
The stadium volume is $(2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $(2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball} > (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$, one more insertion is sufficient to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In each insertion, the number of golf balls inserted doubles.
Number of balls in insertion $n$ is $2^{n-1}$.
Total number of balls after $n$ insertions is $N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
Volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then the total number of insertions will be $30+x$.
The volume of balls after $30+x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$

Let's check for $x=1$:
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, $x=1$ is sufficient.

Let's check for $x=0$:
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.
So, $x=0$ is not sufficient.

Therefore, the minimum number of additional insertions needed is $x=1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the first insertion, 1 ball is inserted. In the second insertion, 2 balls are inserted. In the third insertion, 4 balls are inserted, and so on. In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $k$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$$N_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$$
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $k$ insertions is $V_k = N_k \times V_{ball} = (2^k - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So, the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium's volume:
$$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$$
This means that the full volume of the stadium is:
$$V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$$

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $n$ be the number of insertions required to fill the stadium. Then the volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions should be equal to the stadium's volume:
$$V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$$
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$$(2^n - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$$2^n - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$$
Add 1 to both sides:
$$2^n = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$$
$$2^n = 2^{31} - 1$$
We are looking for an integer $n$ that satisfies this equation. If we consider the insertions after the 30th, at the 31st insertion, the total volume will be $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We notice that $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$ is very close to $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$, but slightly larger.
However, let's re-read the question. "how many insertions are LEFT to fill it".
If at 30th insertion it is half full, and at 31st insertion the volume of balls becomes $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$, and $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
It appears there's a slight inconsistency in the problem statement if we expect an integer number of insertions to exactly fill the stadium. However, if we assume that "fill it" means to reach or exceed the stadium volume for the first time, then we are looking for the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th to reach or exceed $V_{stadium}$.

Since $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$ and $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$, we see that $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is filled (or slightly overfilled).
We are already at the 30th insertion. Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, given as $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In each insertion, the number of balls inserted doubles.
Insertion 1: $2^{1-1} = 1$ ball
Insertion 2: $2^{2-1} = 2$ balls
Insertion 3: $2^{3-1} = 4$ balls
...
Insertion n: $2^{n-1}$ balls

The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$

The total volume of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the total number of insertions required to fill the stadium.
$V_x = (2^x - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^x - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^x = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^x = 2^{31} - 1$

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.
Let $y$ be the number of insertions left. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + y$.
We want to find $y$ such that $x = 30 + y$.
$2^{30+y} = 2^{31} - 1$

However, we can also consider the remaining volume at the 30th insertion.
The remaining volume to be filled is $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
In the next insertion (31st insertion), we add $2^{31-1} = 2^{30}$ balls.
The volume added in the 31st insertion is $2^{30} \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{30} \times V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$, one more insertion is sufficient to fill the remaining volume.

Thus, only 1 insertion is left to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V_n$ be the total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions.
The number of balls inserted in the $i$-th insertion is $2^{i-1}$.
The volume of each golf ball is $40 cm^3$.
So, the volume inserted in the $i$-th insertion is $2^{i-1} \times 40 cm^3$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is the sum of the volumes inserted in each insertion from 1 to $n$:
$V_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2^{i-1} \times 40) = 40 \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 40 \times (2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{n-1}) = 40 \times (2^n - 1)$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
$V_{30} = 40 \times (2^{30} - 1) = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
So, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times 40 \times (2^{30} - 1) = 80 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions. Then we are looking at the $(30+x)$-th insertion. The total volume after $(30+x)$ insertions is:
$V_{30+x} = 40 \times (2^{30+x} - 1)$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$40 \times (2^{30+x} - 1) \ge 80 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
Divide both sides by 40:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is.
So, $x=1$ is sufficient.
Let's check for $x=0$.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2^{31} = 0$ and $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{30}$.

Thus, the smallest integer $x$ is 1.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium from the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions is $30 + x$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} \ge V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$.
$2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, $2^{31} > 2^{31} - 1$.
So, 1 additional insertion is enough to fill the stadium (and even overfill it slightly).

Let's check for $x=0$.
$2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$.
Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, $2^{30} < 2^{31} - 1$.
So, 0 additional insertions is not enough.

Therefore, the minimum number of insertions needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, and $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$N(n) = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V(n) = N(n) \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V(30) = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find $x$ such that $V(30+x) = V_{stadium}$.
$V(30+x) = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball}$
We set $V(30+x) = V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We want to find integer $x$. Let's consider if $x=1$.
If $x=1$, total insertions = $30+1=31$.
Volume after 31 insertions $V(31) = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Stadium volume $V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

Comparing $V(31)$ and $V_{stadium}$:
$V(31) = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
$V(31) > V_{stadium}$
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
However, at 30 insertions it is half full, and with each insertion volume roughly doubles. So it makes sense that only one more insertion is needed to go from half full to full.

Since at 30th insertion the stadium is half full, to fill the remaining half, we need to add the same volume again.
Volume at 30th insertion is $(2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
In the 31st insertion, we add $2^{30}$ balls, which is $2^{30} V_{ball}$ volume.
Since $2^{30} V_{ball} > (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$, adding one more insertion (the 31st) will fill the remaining volume and slightly more.
Therefore, only 1 more insertion is needed after the 30th to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $V$ be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{ cm}^3$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After $n$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is the sum of a geometric series:
$$S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$$
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times v = (2^n - 1)v$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{V}{2}$$
We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied after $30+x$ insertions should be equal to the full volume $V$.
$$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1)v = V$$
From the first equation, we have $V = 2V_{30} = 2(2^{30} - 1)v$.
Substituting this into the second equation:
$$(2^{30+x} - 1)v = 2(2^{30} - 1)v$$
Divide both sides by $v$:
$$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2(2^{30} - 1)$$
$$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2$$
$$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$$
$$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$$
$$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$$
We want to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.
Let's consider what happens if $x=1$.
If $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$.
We know $V = 2(2^{30} - 1)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$
$V = (2^{31} - 2)v$
$V_{31} > V$
So, after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly more than full. Since at 30th insertion it was half full, it means that just one more insertion is sufficient to fill the stadium.
The number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is approximately 40 cm$^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is given by the sum of a geometric series:
$N(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V(n) = N(n) \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means:
$V(30) = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that the stadium is at least full after $30 + x$ insertions.
$V(30+x) = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V(30+x) \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 < 2^{31}$, we can choose $2^{30+x} = 2^{31}$.
This gives $30+x = 31$, so $x = 1$.
Let's check if $x=1$ is sufficient.
For $x=1$, $2^{30+1} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
We need to check if $2^{31} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is true.

So, after 1 more insertion (a total of 31 insertions), the stadium will be at least full.
Since we are asked "how many insertions are left to fill it", and at 30th insertion it is half full, it takes 1 more insertion to fill it (or slightly exceed it).

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted in the $i$-th insertion.
We are given that $N_i = 2^{i-1}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, ...$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{n-1}$.
This is a geometric series with first term $a = 1$, common ratio $r = 2$, and $n$ terms.
The sum of this geometric series is $S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} = \frac{1(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.

The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = V_{ball} \times S_n = V_{ball} \times (2^n - 1)$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
So, $V_{30} = V_{ball} \times (2^{30} - 1) = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This means $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{ball} \times (2^{30} - 1)$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + k$.
The total volume after $30 + k$ insertions is $V_{30+k} = V_{ball} \times (2^{30+k} - 1)$.
For the stadium to be full, we need $V_{30+k} = V_{stadium}$.
$V_{ball} \times (2^{30+k} - 1) = 2 \times V_{ball} \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 1$.

If we approximate $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$, then $2^{30+k} \approx 2^{31}$, which means $30+k \approx 31$, so $k \approx 1$.
Let's check if $k=1$ is the exact answer.
If $k=1$, the total number of insertions is $30+1 = 31$.
Volume after 31 insertions is $V_{31} = V_{ball} \times (2^{31} - 1)$.
Is $V_{31} = V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{ball} \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$V_{31} = V_{ball} \times (2^{31} - 1) = V_{ball} \times (2 \times 2^{30} - 1)$.
$V_{stadium} = V_{ball} \times (2 \times 2^{30} - 2)$.
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$ because $(2 \times 2^{30} - 1) > (2 \times 2^{30} - 2)$.

We are asked "how many insertions are left to fill it". Since at 30th insertion stadium is half full, and at 31st insertion it is slightly over full, it means that just one more insertion is needed to fill the stadium (or slightly overfill, but we are looking for the number of insertions to fill it).
Therefore, 1 more insertion is left to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions, say $x$, needed to fill the stadium.
So, we are looking for the number of insertions $30 + x$ such that the stadium is full.
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$.
If $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$.
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V_{stadium}$, we see that $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
However, the question asks for the number of insertions left to fill it, which implies we are looking for the point at which it becomes full or just full.
Since at insertion 30 it is half full, and in each subsequent insertion the number of balls doubles, it will take only one more insertion to more than double the filled volume, thus exceeding the full capacity.
If we consider integer number of insertions, then just after the 30th insertion being half full, the next insertion will make it full (or slightly overfull).
So, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?1?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?1?Let $N_i$ be the number of golf balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion. We are given that the number of balls doubles with each insertion, starting with 1 ball in the first insertion. So, $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.

Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball, and $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
The volume filled after $n$ insertions is $V_{filled\_n} = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{filled\_30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{filled\_30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Therefore, $\frac{1}{2} V_{stadium} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$, which means $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $x$ be the number of insertions needed in total to fill the stadium. Then, the volume filled after $x$ insertions should be equal to $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{filled\_x} = (2^x - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$, we get:
$2^x - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^x = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^x = 2^{31} - 1$.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Let $y$ be the number of insertions left. So, the total number of insertions will be $30 + y$. Thus, we need to find $y$ such that $x = 30 + y$.
$2^{30+y} = 2^{31} - 1$.

Since $2^{30+y}$ must be a power of 2, and $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2^{31}$, we can approximate $2^{30+y} \approx 2^{31}$.
This gives $30 + y \approx 31$, so $y \approx 1$.

Let's check for $y=1$. If we have $30+1 = 31$ insertions, the volume filled is:
$V_{filled\_31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
And we know $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, $V_{filled\_31} > V_{stadium}$.
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
Since at 30 insertions it is half full, and at 31 insertions it is full (or slightly overfull), it means that just 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium after the 30th insertion.

Number of insertions left = 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is approximately $40 cm^3$.
Let $N_i$ be the number of balls inserted at the $i$-th insertion, where $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$

We want to find the number of additional insertions, say $x$, needed to fill the stadium completely. So, we need to find the total number of insertions $30+x$ such that the volume of balls inserted is equal to $V_{stadium}$.
$V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We are looking for an integer value for $x$. Let's consider if $x=1$.
If $x=1$, total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
Volume at 31st insertion = $(2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to check if this volume is equal to $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We can see that $2^{31} - 1$ is very close to $2 \times (2^{30} - 1) = 2^{31} - 2$.
Since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$, the stadium will be slightly overfilled at the 31st insertion if we assume half full means exactly half volume.
However, if we consider the doubling nature, and that at 30th insertion it is half full, then with the next insertion (doubling the balls inserted cumulatively), it should become full or more than full.
Let's check the ratio:
$\frac{2^{31} - 1}{2^{30} - 1} = \frac{2 \times 2^{30} - 1}{2^{30} - 1} = \frac{2 \times (2^{30} - 1) + 2 - 1}{2^{30} - 1} = 2 + \frac{1}{2^{30} - 1}$
This ratio is slightly greater than 2. So, by going from 30th to 31st insertion, the volume more than doubles, hence it should become more than full. But the question asks "how many insertions are LEFT to fill it", implying exactly filled at some point.
Considering the approximation, $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$, so $30+x \approx 31$, $x \approx 1$.
Since we are asked for number of insertions left to fill it, and at 30th it's half full, and the number of balls roughly doubles with each step, it implies that one more step is needed to fill the remaining half (and slightly more).
Therefore, the number of insertions left is 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is approximately $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$Total\_balls(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume occupied by the golf balls after $n$ insertions is:
$Total\_volume(n) = Total\_balls(n) \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
$Total\_volume(30) = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then, the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The total volume occupied after $30 + x$ insertions should be equal to the total volume of the stadium:
$Total\_volume(30 + x) = (2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$.
Substitute the expression for $V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
We need to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.
If we consider $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$, and $2^{31} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
So, $x=1$ is the solution.
Therefore, there is only 1 insertion left to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let V be the total volume of the stadium.
Let $V_n$ be the volume occupied by the golf balls after n insertions.
The volume of a single golf ball is $v = 40 cm^3$.
In the first insertion, 1 ball is inserted.
In the second insertion, 2 balls are inserted.
In the third insertion, 4 balls are inserted.
In the nth insertion, $2^{n-1}$ balls are inserted.

The total number of balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = \frac{1 \cdot (2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$

The volume occupied by the balls after n insertions is:
$V_n = N_n \cdot v = (2^n - 1) \cdot v$

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full:
$V_{30} = \frac{V}{2} = (2^{30} - 1) \cdot v$
So the full volume of the stadium is:
$V = 2 \cdot V_{30} = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot v$

We want to find the number of additional insertions, say x, needed to fill the stadium completely. So we are looking for the number of insertions needed to reach volume V, starting from the 30th insertion. The total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied after $30 + x$ insertions is:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) \cdot v$
We want $V_{30+x} = V$:
$(2^{30+x} - 1) \cdot v = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot v$

Divide both sides by v:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2$
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

We need to find an integer x that satisfies this equation. Let's check if x=1 is a solution or very close to a solution.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$.
We compare $2^{31}$ with $2^{31} - 1$.
$2^{31} \approx 2^{31} - 1$.
Since we are asked for the number of insertions left to fill it, and the volume doubles with each insertion step (approximately), it makes sense that only 1 more insertion is needed.

Let's check if for $x=1$, the stadium is at least full.
For $x=1$, $V_{30+1} = V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \cdot v$.
Is $V_{31} \ge V$
Is $(2^{31} - 1) \cdot v \ge 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1) \cdot v$
Is $2^{31} - 1 \ge 2 \cdot (2^{30} - 1)$
Is $2^{31} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$
Yes, $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$.
So, after 1 more insertion, the stadium is slightly over full or exactly full in a practical sense. Since we are looking for the number of insertions *left to fill it*, and at 30 insertions it is half full, and the volume approximately doubles with each insertion, 1 more insertion should be enough to fill the remaining half.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, which is $40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $2^{n-1}$.
After 30 insertions, the total number of balls inserted is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_{30} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{29} = \sum_{i=0}^{29} 2^i = \frac{2^{30} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{30} - 1$.
The total volume occupied by these balls is $V_{30} = N_{30} \times V_{ball} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
We are given that at the 30th insertion the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
$V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
After $30 + x$ insertions, the total number of balls inserted is $N_{30+x} = 2^{30+x} - 1$.
The total volume occupied by these balls is $V_{30+x} = N_{30+x} \times V_{ball} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball}$.
To fill the stadium, we need $V_{30+x} = V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$.
If we consider that $2^{30}$ is a very large number, then $2^{31} - 1 \approx 2^{31}$.
So, $2^{30+x} \approx 2^{31}$.
$30+x \approx 31$.
$x \approx 1$.

Let's check if $x=1$ is the exact integer solution.
If $x = 1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$2^{31} - 1 = 2^{31} - 1$.
This equation holds true.
So, the number of additional insertions needed is $x=1$.

Number of insertions left = 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 cm^3$.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, the number of balls inserted is $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $B_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = B_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. So,
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 \times V_{30} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium. Let $k$ be the number of additional insertions. Then we are looking for the total number of insertions $30 + k$ such that the stadium is full.
The volume of balls after $30+k$ insertions is $V_{30+k} = (2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $k \ge 0$ such that $V_{30+k} \ge V_{stadium}$.
We set $V_{30+k} = V_{stadium}$:
$(2^{30+k} - 1) \times V_{ball} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+k} - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+k} = 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find an integer $k$. Let's check for $k=1$.
For $k=1$, total insertions = $30+1 = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$.
Is $V_{31} = V_{stadium}$ or $V_{31} \ge V_{stadium}$
We know $V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) \times V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) \times V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
Comparing $V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) \times V_{ball}$ with $V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) \times V_{ball}$.
We see that $V_{31} > V_{stadium}$.
So, after 1 more insertion, the stadium is slightly overfilled.
Since at 30th insertion it was half full, and we are adding balls in discrete insertions, and we want to know how many insertions are LEFT TO FILL it, and we found that 1 more insertion fills or slightly overfills it, then the answer should be 1.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V$ be the volume of the stadium.
Let $v = 40 \text{cm}^3$ be the volume of a golf ball.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
After $k$ insertions, the total number of golf balls inserted is $\sum_{n=1}^{k} 2^{n-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = \frac{2^k - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^k - 1$.
The total volume occupied by golf balls after $k$ insertions is $V_k = (2^k - 1)v$.

At the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = \frac{V}{2}$.
This means the full volume of the stadium is $V = 2V_{30} = 2(2^{30} - 1)v = (2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2)v = (2^{31} - 2)v$.

We want to find the number of insertions left to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed to fill the stadium.
The total number of insertions will be $30 + x$.
The volume occupied by golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions is $V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1)v$.
We want to find the smallest integer $x$ such that $V_{30+x} \ge V$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1)v \ge V = (2^{31} - 2)v$.
Divide both sides by $v$ (since $v > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

Let's check for $x=1$.
If $x=1$, then $30+x = 31$.
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1)v$.
Is $V_{31} \ge V$
Is $(2^{31} - 1)v \ge (2^{31} - 2)v$
Yes, since $2^{31} - 1 > 2^{31} - 2$.
So, after 1 more insertion, the stadium is filled (or overfilled).

Let's check for $x=0$.
If $x=0$, then $30+x = 30$.
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1)v = V/2$. It is half full, not full.

Thus, we need 1 more insertion to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a single golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the total volume of the stadium.
In the $i$-th insertion, $2^{i-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is the sum of a geometric series:
$N_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls after $n$ insertions is $V_n = N_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means that the volume of golf balls after 30 insertions is half of the stadium volume:
$V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
From this, we can find the total volume of the stadium:
$V_{stadium} = 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$. The volume of golf balls after $30 + x$ insertions should be equal to or just exceed the stadium volume $V_{stadium}$:
$V_{30+x} = (2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} \ge V_{stadium}$.
$(2^{30+x} - 1) V_{ball} \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$):
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times (2^{30} - 1)$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2 \times 2^{30} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^{30+x} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

We need to find the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies this inequality.
If $x = 1$, then $2^{30+1} = 2^{31}$. Is $2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ Yes, it is true because $2^{31} - (2^{31} - 1) = 1 \ge 0$.
If $x = 0$, then $2^{30+0} = 2^{30}$. Is $2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$ No, because $2^{31} - 1 - 2^{30} = 2 \times 2^{30} - 1 - 2^{30} = 2^{30} - 1 > 0$.

Therefore, the smallest integer value for $x$ is 1. This means that only 1 more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball.
Let $V_{stadium}$ be the volume of the stadium.
In the $n$-th insertion, $2^{n-1}$ golf balls are inserted.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $V_n = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
This means the full volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \cdot 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $N$ be the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium.
We want to find $N$ such that $V_N \ge V_{stadium}$.
$V_N = (2^N - 1) V_{ball}$.
We want to find the smallest integer $N$ such that $(2^N - 1) V_{ball} \ge V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$.
Dividing both sides by $V_{ball}$ (since $V_{ball} > 0$), we get:
$2^N - 1 \ge 2^{31} - 2$.
$2^N \ge 2^{31} - 2 + 1$.
$2^N \ge 2^{31} - 1$.

We want to find the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality.
Let's check for $N = 31$.
$2^{31} \ge 2^{31} - 1$. This is true.
Let's check for $N = 30$.
$2^{30} \ge 2^{31} - 1$.
$2^{30} \ge 2 \cdot 2^{30} - 1$.
$1 \ge 2^{30}$. This is false.
So the smallest integer $N$ is 31.

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion.
Since it takes 31 insertions to fill the stadium, and we have already done 30 insertions, the number of insertions left is $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?Let $V_{ball}$ be the volume of a golf ball, $V_{ball} = 40 \text{cm}^3$.
Let $N_i$ be the number of balls inserted in the $i$-th insertion, where $N_i = 2^{i-1}$.
The total number of balls inserted after $n$ insertions is $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1} = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1$.
The volume filled after $n$ insertions is $V_n = S_n \times V_{ball} = (2^n - 1) V_{ball}$.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full.
So, $V_{30} = (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} V_{stadium}$.
Therefore, the total volume of the stadium is $V_{stadium} = 2 V_{30} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$.

We want to find the number of insertions needed to fill the stadium completely. Let $k$ be the total number of insertions needed to fill the stadium. Then the volume filled after $k$ insertions must be equal to the stadium volume.
$V_k = (2^k - 1) V_{ball} = V_{stadium}$
$(2^k - 1) V_{ball} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball}$
Divide both sides by $V_{ball}$:
$2^k - 1 = 2 (2^{30} - 1)$
$2^k - 1 = 2^{31} - 2$
$2^k = 2^{31} - 2 + 1$
$2^k = 2^{31} - 1$

We are asked for the number of insertions *left* to fill it after the 30th insertion. Let $x$ be the number of additional insertions needed after the 30th insertion. Then the total number of insertions will be $30 + x$, so $k = 30 + x$.
$2^{30+x} = 2^{31} - 1$

Since $2^{31} - 1$ is slightly less than $2^{31}$, $30+x$ must be slightly less than $31$. However, the number of insertions must be an integer.
Let's examine the volume filled after 31 insertions:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$
And the stadium volume is $V_{stadium} = 2 (2^{30} - 1) V_{ball} = (2 \times 2^{30} - 2) V_{ball} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
Comparing $V_{31}$ and $V_{stadium}$:
$V_{31} = (2^{31} - 1) V_{ball}$
$V_{stadium} = (2^{31} - 2) V_{ball}$
$V_{31} > V_{stadium}$
This means that after 31 insertions, the stadium is overfilled.
After 30 insertions, the stadium is half full.
So, to fill the stadium from half full to full, we need to add insertions.
Since 31 insertions overfills, and 30 is half full, the number of additional insertions needed to *fill* it (meaning to reach at least full capacity) is 1.

Number of insertions left = $31 - 30 = 1$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$?
