dy/dx = d/dx (x*sin(x)) = sin(x) + x*cos(x)

To find the critical points, we set dy/dx = 0:
sin(x) + x*cos(x) = 0
sin(x) = -x*cos(x)
tan(x) = -x

We need to solve tan(x) = -x in the interval [0, pi].
We can graphically analyze the intersection of y = tan(x) and y = -x in the interval [0, pi].
In the interval [0, pi/2), tan(x) >= 0 and -x <= 0, they intersect at x = 0.
In the interval (pi/2, pi), tan(x) goes from -infinity to 0, and -x goes from -pi/2 to -pi. There is an intersection in this interval.

We check the value of the function at the endpoints and critical points.
At x = 0, y = 0*sin(0) = 0.
At x = pi, y = pi*sin(pi) = 0.

We need to find the solution of tan(x) = -x in (pi/2, pi). Let's call this solution x0.
Numerically solving tan(x) = -x in (pi/2, pi), we find x0  2.0287578.
At x = x0, y0 = x0*sin(x0)  2.0287578 * sin(2.0287578)  1.8216593.

Comparing the values at the endpoints and the critical point:
y(0) = 0
y(pi) = 0
y(x0)  1.8216593

The maximum value occurs at x = x0  2.0287578, and the maximum value is y0  1.8216593.
We are asked to give the answer in the form (x0, y0).
Rounding to 5 decimal places, we get (2.02876, 1.82166).

dy/dx = sin(x) + x*cos(x)

Set the derivative to zero to find critical points:
sin(x) + x*cos(x) = 0
tan(x) = -x

We need to solve tan(x) = -x in the interval [0, pi].
We know that x=0 is a solution, as tan(0) = 0 and -0 = 0.
For x in (0, pi/2), tan(x) > 0 and -x < 0, so there is no solution in (0, pi/2).
For x in (pi/2, pi), tan(x) is negative and varies from -infinity to 0, while -x is negative and varies from -pi/2 to -pi. There is one solution in (pi/2, pi).
Using numerical methods or a calculator, we find the approximate solution to tan(x) = -x in (pi/2, pi) to be x  2.02876.

Now we evaluate the function y = x*sin(x) at the critical points and endpoints:
At x = 0, y = 0*sin(0) = 0.
At x = pi, y = pi*sin(pi) = 0.
At x  2.02876, y  2.02876 * sin(2.02876).
sin(2.02876)  0.89854.
y  2.02876 * 0.89854  1.82292.

Comparing the values, the maximum value is approximately 1.82292 at x  2.02876.
The maximum point is approximately (2.02876, 1.82292).

Rounding to 3 decimal places for simplicity and clarity, we get x  2.029 and y  1.823.
The maximum point is approximately (2.029, 1.823).
For more precision, we use 5 decimal places.

dy/dx = d/dx (x*sin(x))
Using the product rule, we get:
dy/dx = (1)*sin(x) + x*cos(x) = sin(x) + x*cos(x)

To find the critical points, we set dy/dx = 0:
sin(x) + x*cos(x) = 0
sin(x) = -x*cos(x)
tan(x) = -x

We need to solve for x in the interval [0, pi]. We can see that x=0 is not a solution as tan(0) = 0 and -0 = 0, but we need to check if this is a maximum or minimum later by checking the second derivative or by evaluating function values at endpoints and critical points.
However, let's examine the equation tan(x) = -x again in the interval [0, pi]. We are interested in non-zero solutions.
In the interval (0, pi/2), tan(x) > 0 and -x < 0, so there is no solution in (0, pi/2).
In the interval (pi/2, pi), tan(x) goes from -infinity to 0, and -x goes from -pi/2 to -pi. There should be one intersection in this interval.

Using a numerical solver, we find the solution to tan(x) = -x in (pi/2, pi) is approximately x  2.02876.

Now we evaluate the function y = x*sin(x) at the endpoints and the critical point.
At x = 0: y = 0*sin(0) = 0
At x = pi: y = pi*sin(pi) = pi*0 = 0
At x  2.02876: y = 2.02876 * sin(2.02876)  2.02876 * 0.924376  1.87515
