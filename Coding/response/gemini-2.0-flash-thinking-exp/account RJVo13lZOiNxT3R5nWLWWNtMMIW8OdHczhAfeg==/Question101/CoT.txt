Rationale:
Let V be the volume of the stadium and v be the volume of a golf ball.
The number of golf balls inserted in each insertion follows a geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, 8, ... , 2^(n-1) for the n-th insertion.
The total number of golf balls inserted after n insertions is the sum of this geometric series:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(n-1) = 2^n - 1.
The total volume of golf balls inserted after n insertions is (2^n - 1) * v.

We are given that at the 30th insertion, the stadium is exactly half full. This means:
(2^30 - 1) * v = V / 2
So, the full volume of the stadium is V = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v.

We want to find out how many more insertions are needed to fill the stadium completely starting from the 30th insertion. Let's assume we need 'x' more insertions after the 30th insertion to fill the stadium. This means we are looking at a total of 30 + x insertions to fill the stadium.
The total volume of golf balls after (30 + x) insertions is (2^(30+x) - 1) * v.
For the stadium to be full, this volume must be equal to V:
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v = V
(2^(30+x) - 1) * v = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v
Divide both sides by v:
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * (2^30 - 1)
2^(30+x) - 1 = 2 * 2^30 - 2
2^(30+x) = 2 * 2^30 - 2 + 1
2^(30+x) = 2 * 2^30 - 1
2^(30+x) = 2^31 - 1

Let's test for x=1.  Then 30+x = 31 insertions.
Volume after 31 insertions = (2^31 - 1) * v.
Is this equal to V = 2 * (2^30 - 1) * v = (2^31 - 2) * v
(2^31 - 1) * v is slightly greater than (2^31 - 2) * v.
However, given the nature of the problem and the doubling at each step, it is highly likely that we are looking for the insertion number where the stadium is just filled or slightly overfilled for the first time.
Since at 30 insertions it is half full, and at 31 insertions the volume becomes (2^31 - 1) * v which is greater than V = (2^31 - 2) * v, it means that just one more insertion is needed to fill the stadium.
Therefore, the number of insertions left to fill it is 1.
