100 years.?100 years. 

Calculation:

*   **Population decrease:** 60,000,000 * 0.30 = 18,000,000
*   **Remaining population:** 60,000,000 - 18,000,000 = 42,000,000
*   **Halved population:** 42,000,000 / 2 = 21,000,000

However, this is incorrect.  The population is decreasing by 30,000 per year.  We need to calculate the number of years it takes for the population to halve.

*   **Halved population:** 60,000,000 / 2 = 30,000,000

Therefore, it takes 3000000 years.

Let's re-evaluate.

The population is decreasing by 30,000 per year.  The current population is 60,000,000.  We want to find the number of years to halve the population.

Population decrease per year = 30,000
Population = 60,000,000

We want to find the time it takes to reduce the population by half.

Time = Population / 2 = 60,000,000 / 2 = 30,000,000
