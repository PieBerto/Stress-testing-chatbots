?Lets analyze the constraints again.

**Initial State:**

[A, B, C, Z]

**Intermediate States:**

1.  **[A, B, C, Z]**  Farmer carries cabbage across. Goat and wolf remain.
2.  **[A, C, B, Z]**  Farmer carries cabbage across. Goat and wolf remain.
3.  **[A, B, C, Z]**  Farmer carries goat across.  Cabbage and wolf remain.
4.  **[A, C, B, Z]**  Farmer carries goat across.  Cabbage and wolf remain.
5.  **[A, B, C, Z]**  Farmer carries wolf across.  Cabbage and goat remain.
6.  **[A, C, B, Z]**  Farmer carries wolf across.  Cabbage and goat remain.

**Final State:**

[A, B, C, Z]

**Explanation:**

The farmer starts with the cabbage and goat. The goat and wolf must be moved to the other side. The only possible arrangement is the initial state.
