?Lets analyze the constraints again.

**Initial State:**

[A, B, C, Z]

**Intermediate States:**

1.  **[A, B, C, Z]**  Farmer carries cabbage across. Goat and wolf remain.
2.  **[A, C, B, Z]**  Farmer carries cabbage across. Goat and wolf remain.
3.  **[A, B, C, Z]**  Farmer carries goat across.  Cabbage and wolf remain.
4.  **[A, C, B, Z]**  Farmer carries goat across.  Cabbage and wolf remain.
5.  **[A, B, C, Z]**  Farmer carries wolf across.  Cabbage and goat remain.
6.  **[A, C, B, Z]**  Farmer carries wolf across.  Cabbage and goat remain.

**Final State:**

[A, B, C, Z]

**Explanation:**

The farmer starts with the cabbage and goat. The goat and wolf must be moved to the other side. The only possible arrangement is the initial state.

Scenario 1: Farmer -> Z.  C -> A, G -> B, W -> C. Move C, G, W to the other bank.

Scenario 2: Farmer -> Z.  C -> B, G -> A, W -> C. Move C, G, W to the other bank.

Scenario 3: Farmer -> Z.  C -> A, W -> B, G -> C. Move C, G, W to the other bank.

Scenario 4: Farmer -> Z.  C -> B, W -> A, G -> C. Move C, G, W to the other bank.

...and so on.

The sequence is a repeating pattern.  The initial state is the first state.  The pattern repeats.

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```
The sequence repeats.

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```
The sequence repeats.
```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```
The sequence is: A B C Z, B C Z A, C Z A B, Z A B C, ...
The pattern repeats.

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```
The sequence is: A B C Z, B C Z A, C Z A B, Z A B C.

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
C Z A B
Z A B C
```

```
A B C Z
B C Z A
