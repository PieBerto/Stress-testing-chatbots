[A, B, C, Z] ; []?Here are the steps:

[A, B, C, Z] -> [A, C, Z]
[B] -> [A, C, Z; B]

[A, C, Z] -> [A, C]
[B, Z] -> [A, C; B, Z]

[A, C] -> [B, A, Z]
[B, Z] -> [A, C; B, Z]

[A, B, C, Z] is not possible so we move the farmer back and put him on the left bank.
[A, C, B, Z] -> [A,C,B,Z] 
Now we move the farmer from the left to the right side with the goat.
[A, C]
[B, A, Z] -> [B,A,Z]

Now let's bring the wolf with the farmer 
[A, B, C, Z] -> [A, B, C, Z; A, B, Z]

[A, B, C, Z] -> [A, B, C]
[B, A, Z] is not possible so we move the farmer from the left to the right side with the goat.
[A, B, C, Z] -> [B,A,Z]
Now let's bring the wolf with the farmer 
[A, B, C, Z] -> [A,B,C,Z]

[A, B, C, Z] -> [A, B, C]
[B, A, Z] is not possible so we move the farmer from the left to the right side with the goat.
Now we are on [B, A, Z]
Now let's bring the wolf with the farmer
