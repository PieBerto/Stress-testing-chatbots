We want to fill a stadium with golf balls (whose volume can be aproximated to 40cm^3). The balls inserted double with each insertion: 1 ball in the first insertion, 2 balls in the second, 4 in the third, .... If at the 30th insertion the stage is exactly half full, how may insertions are left to fill it? Answer only with the number that solves the problem and nothing more!
